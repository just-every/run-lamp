# Demo mode

Import `withDemo` first in the Worker entry and wrap the worker with
`withDemo(worker, { seed })`. It changes behavior only with `RER_DEMO=1`.
Production build/deploy refuses that setting; ordinary builds keep real effects.

- Public internet reads and checks run for real: pages, feeds, previews and
  monitor probes against any URL. GET, HEAD and OPTIONS use the real network.
  A check using POST uses `fetchDemoRead(url, init)` to declare read intent.
  Redirects pass through the same policy at every hop.
- Third-party writes are mocked: external POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE, message
  APIs and webhook URLs return success without contacting their destination.
  Common mail, SMS and chat providers receive their normal success envelope;
  generic JSON writes receive their submitted resource with a generated ID.
  For an SDK, binding or another non-HTTP transport use
  `demoEffect(() => realSend(), () => providerSuccess)` around the effect.
  Without `RER_DEMO` this always executes `realSend`. A seed with a richer
  provider response should supply its own exact success shape this way.
- Mail in local dev and demo is silently suppressed. There is no outbox or
  blocked-send UI. Logs contain only the mocked request's method and host.
- The configured owner's authenticated session supplies step-up proof inside
  its own demo, including owner invitations and role changes. The demo guard
  must be active; ordinary hosted instances still require real proof. Each
  visitor's separate session secret and store reject other visitors' cookies.
- `seed(env, { ownerEmail, now })` runs once after the owner exists and must
  be idempotent. Its only table is the demo's throwaway `rer_demo` marker.
- Base adds ` Demo` to the document title, including client-side navigation.
  Put `data-rer-name` on the product's text label, for example
  `<span data-rer-name>Uptime</span>`, to show **Uptime Demo** in its nav.
  The same attribute shows **Uptime Dev** under the local dev wrapper. No bar,
  layout offset or timer is injected. In demo mode a **Run <Seed>** link sits
  beside each marked navigation label and opens `https://<domain>/run`. The
  existing `demoSockets()` Vite plugin supplies the public `name` and canonical
  run-site `domain` from `deploy-demo.json` and the command adapter's
  `site.declaration` (normally `deploy-site.json`); an explicit HTTPS `/run`
  `runUrl` in the demo declaration takes precedence and is validated for both
  local and hosted demos. No per-seed link is required. CSS adds the label suffix without
  changing the application's hydrated text; CSP allows exact hashes only.

  The exit uses only spare space beside or directly below the label and truncates its own text.
  It stays out of the host layout, preserving sibling rectangles and document
  width relative to the same header with the Demo suffix but no exit. It never
  repairs an already overflowing host header. With no readable room it remains
  a keyboard stop; keyboard focus reveals the full link above clipping ancestors.
  The full name is also its accessible name and title. The host keeps ownership
  of its responsive layout.

Public sockets, WebSockets and event streams remain usable for checks. The
local sockets guard and hosted egress retain a small direct mail/SMS denylist;
use the effect helper for such sends. Hosted demos keep their isolated
container, Turnstile, per-IP start limit, TTL/idle end and maximum instances.
