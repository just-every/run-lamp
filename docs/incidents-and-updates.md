# Incidents and updates

Open **Incidents** and choose **New incident** (an empty list opens it for you).
One screen asks what is happening (a title and the impact), who is affected (the
components and the people), and when the next update is; **Publish** creates the
incident and publishes its first update together. Lamp keeps each published
update on the incident timeline; a correction is a new update that names the
one it corrects.

## Compose and publish

Each update asks what is happening and who is affected. For an active incident,
set the next-update time as your communication commitment: 15 min, 30 min,
1 hour or 2 hours fill the time field, or type a time. A resolved update has no
next-update promise.

The **+** beside Publish (**Update options**) holds the rest, in captioned
groups. On a new incident, **Status** sets the status it starts with. **Add to
this update** adds what still works, details, the opening time of an earlier
incident, and Primary or Dependent relationships. **Send** chooses which
subscriber channels to notify and schedules or backdates the update.
**Templates** has **Use a template**, which picks a saved template and fills the
update from it, and **Save as a template**. **Draft** has **Save as private
draft** for an incident you are not ready to publish, and on an existing
incident **Mark draft reviewed** and **Publish as a correction…**. The note
beside Publish says who it notifies. Editing a saved template is in
**Settings › Templates**.

Review the preview before publishing; **Page** and **Email** show both
renderings. An unpublished draft stays private. A future scheduled update also
stays private until its scheduled publication time. Each published update sets
the incident lifecycle: Investigating, Identified, Monitoring or Resolved; on an
open incident, choose it above the fields. Delivery figures appear once
something was sent. Under the timeline, the incident panel lists named rows:
**Brief**, **Reach** (once something was sent), **Notes** (internal), **Impact**
(the public impact), the **Post-incident report** once resolved,
**Communication owner** and **Incident subscribers**, then a quiet **Delete
incident**. Each row shows one line and opens on its name.

To reopen an incident resolved in error, publish an update that sets it to
Investigating. The resolution and reopening updates both remain in history. You
can also create a retroactive incident with updates dated in the past; its
component history uses those times and subscribers are not notified about those
retroactive updates.

## Change affected components

Each attached component is a chip under **Who's affected?** showing the state
the next update will set; change it in the chip. Choose **+ Add component** to
include another public component; set Primary or Dependent from **Relationship…**
in the **+** (Update options).
Internal components stay out of that picker.

Saving keeps these choices private in the versioned draft. Preview shows the
changes; review and scheduling retain them. Publishing commits the wording and
states together, so Major outage can step directly to Degraded performance.
Other incidents, standing claims and maintenance still determine the resulting
public state. A conflicting attachment change requires a fresh review.

Choose Operational in a chip to stop claiming an outage while retaining the
attachment and its subscribers. Resolved releases every
claim. Customers receive one notification per selected channel, containing the
wording and the component changes.

## Wording and links

Settings lets the owner list terms to flag and choose a preferred field length.
The composer also flags resolution-time promises, internal hosts, IP addresses
and email addresses. Each finding appears beside its field and can be dismissed.
These checks never block publishing.

A bare HTTPS URL becomes a link with the URL itself as its label. Trailing
punctuation stays outside the link. HTML, Markdown and other URL schemes remain
literal text. Email HTML links directly to the URL; its text part and generic
webhook bodies retain the original wording. Slack and Teams posts also include
the help links and every populated field.

## Use the brief and suggestions

The incident page shows a brief of accepted alerts, published updates, attached
public components and their claimed states, plus open questions from the saved
incident; it is one line until you open it, and open from the start when alerts
brought facts. The brief is built without a model. Expand its disclosure to see
the exact information a suggestion request would send.

When an AI provider is configured, choose **Suggest update** in the composer.
That action fills only text fields, cites the brief items it uses, leaves your
text in a field when the suggestion has no text for it, and never publishes.
Review every filled field before publishing. Open questions are not valid
sources. Internal notes and internal components are excluded. Lifecycle and
next-update time remain your decision. Without a configured provider, the
suggestion control is absent and Lamp makes no AI request. A failed or
unanswered request shows an error; other publishing paths remain available.

## Track due updates and reports

Overview and the incident list mark an update due beginning 10 minutes before
its committed time. The scheduled trigger sends one due email to active
operators and, if no newer update has replaced that commitment by its time, one
overdue operator email. These are operator alerts, not subscriber notifications.
A newer update or resolution ends the prior commitment. The
public page shows the committed time without a due or overdue label.

After resolving an incident, attach its post-incident report from the incident
page. The report holds a summary, timeline, cause and remediation. The operator
app marks a report as due 7 days after resolution when the incident reached
Partially unavailable or Major outage and has no report.

## Communication owner

Every unresolved incident starts with the operator who opened it as its communication owner. In the private incident composer, **Take over communication** assigns it to you, or **Reassign owner** chooses another active operator; each change is recorded in the audit log. The owner receives the due and overdue email. An incident whose owner is inactive is marked **Unowned** on Overview and all active operators receive its reminder. Ten minutes after the original commitment, `incident.escalation.v1` sends one escalation to every active operator; every operator has publish rights until TEAM-004 roles ship. Ownership never appears on the public page, feeds or subscriber messages. Push, operator chat and Oncall responder delivery are not available yet (MOBILE-002, NOTIFY-016 and INTAKE-012).

### Owed reports

When a major incident owes a report, Lamp emails its communication owner on the due day and once each following week. If no active owner remains, every active operator receives the reminder. The email names the incident and links its report editor, without report content. Publish a report to stop reminders, or use **Waive report reminder** with a non-empty reason; the waiver is recorded in the audit log and removes the incident from the owing list. You can still write and publish a report after waiving it. Operator-chat reminders remain unbuilt under NOTIFY-016.

## Maintenance automation

Each maintenance has **Auto-start maintenance** and **Auto-complete maintenance** switches, both on by default. Turning auto-start off leaves the window Scheduled at its start and sends one operator start-due email; **Start maintenance** publishes its one In progress notice. Turning auto-complete off leaves work In progress at its end, without a Completed notice. From fifteen minutes after the original end it shows **Running longer than planned** and raises one operator overrun email. **Complete maintenance** publishes one Completed notice and releases the maintenance claims. Date-only rescheduling preserves your choices, and you can change auto-complete while work is running without moving its end. Existing windows retain both switches on. The page-wide default setting and operator push are not available yet; this slice does not add MAINT-009 wording, Verifying or imported-message mapping.

## Follow-ups

Overview's **Follow-ups** lists commitments, scheduled publications, maintenance work and reminders, reports owed, imported invitations approaching expiry and notifications awaiting retry. Each item shows its owner, due time, what ends it and any failure, with a link to the work. Completing the work removes it. A failed item can be dismissed with a non-empty reason recorded in the audit log; a later failure appears again. **Retry notification dispatch** explicitly queues another attempt for an unfinished dispatch, and a queue failure remains visible. Accepted deliveries are not reopened. This list is private to operators. Vendor-feed staleness, secondary-origin lag and SMS spend-cap holds remain unavailable under DEP-001, PAGE-022 and NOTIFY-021.

Imported historical incidents remain silent. An owed report can appear in Follow-ups, while automatic report reminders begin only after a live published update on that incident.
