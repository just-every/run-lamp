# Subscribers and notifications

Visitors subscribe by email from the public page. They receive a confirmation
link and become active only after confirming. A pending address expires after
72 hours. Subscribers can manage their component selection or unsubscribe from
their emailed link.

## Follow one incident

Open an incident's permanent page and use **Get updates on this incident**.
Email and webhook subscriptions confirm through the contact's emailed link.
SMS is offered only when it is enabled on the installation and uses its existing
text-message opt-in. These forms work without JavaScript.

An incident follow receives that incident's later published updates and its
resolution, including a reopening before the follow ends. Other incidents,
maintenance and component changes are excluded. Its management link shows
**Following INC-n** and lets the recipient unsubscribe immediately. Operators
can see the audience on the incident and in **Subscribers**.

**Settings → Notifications → Include the post-incident report** defaults on and
sets the initial report choice on each public form. The visitor can change that
choice before submitting; existing subscriptions retain their own choice.
With the report selected, following ends when the
report is published or 30 days after resolution, whichever comes first. With it
unselected, following ends after the resolution is delivered. Lamp removes the ended
follow's address within 24 hours; another subscription at the same address
continues independently. Incident follows use the same confirmation allowance,
pending expiry and channel capacity as other subscriptions. Native archives
retain their incident scope and lifetime.

Management credentials with the explicit `subscribers:read` scope list incident subscribers through
`GET /api/v1/incidents/{incidentId}/subscribers`. The explicit `subscribers:write`
scope creates pending subscriptions with POST and erases one with
`DELETE /api/v1/incidents/{incidentId}/subscribers/{subscriberId}`. These scopes
keep the existing active owner or admin issuer boundary. Revoked credentials
cannot read or write. Existing `read` credentials keep their public-data access
and cannot list subscriber destinations. Native creation accepts `includeReport` as a boolean.
Statuspage-compatible clients use the same credentials with `Authorization: OAuth`
and `/v1/pages/default/incidents/{incidentId}/subscribers`, including the matching
subscriber DELETE door. The edition's local page identifier is `default`.
Imported page and incident subscriptions sharing one address also share the daily
confirmation allowance; a suppressed invitation stays available for a later
explicit owner action.

## Process email unsubscribe requests

Use a From address whose mailbox you monitor. Some mail clients send their
unsubscribe request to that address using the notification's `mailto:` option.
Lamp does not read incoming mail. When a request arrives, open **Subscribers**,
find its destination, choose **Remove**, and confirm the removal. Process these
requests promptly; the address stays subscribed until you remove it.

The HTTPS one-click List-Unsubscribe option works automatically and needs no
operator action. Every email also includes a visible unsubscribe link.

## Choose what each subscriber follows

Subscribers can follow selected components. A subscription that has never been
narrowed follows every visible component, including components added later.
During update composition, choose which available channels receive that update;
the public page, Atom feed and widget always receive it.

Subscription requests are limited to 5 per minute from a requester network
address. Separately, one email address receives at most one confirmation message
in 24 hours.

## Add webhooks or team channels

Open **Subscribers → Add subscriber** to add an email address or a webhook
endpoint with its contact email and selected components. The add sends one
confirmation invitation; the subscription stays pending until the recipient
confirms. The list identifies the operator who added it. Each notification is signed and
contains the incident, its published updates and the affected component state
changes. The delivery log records outcomes; it does not track opens.

Management credentials with the explicit `subscribers:write` scope add the same
subscribers through `POST /api/v1/subscribers`, with **Add subscriber**'s body:
`{"channel":"email","email":"…","componentIds":["…"]}` or
`{"channel":"webhook","destination":"https://…","contactEmail":"…","componentIds":["…"]}`.
The credential acts as its issuer: it sends the same single confirmation, the
subscriber stays pending until the recipient confirms, the list names the
issuer as the adder, and the audit log attributes the addition and its
invitation to the issuer with the credential's ID as the reason. The response
returns the stored record with `201`. A destination that already has a
subscription is left unchanged and returns `200` with `created: false` and only
its subscriber ID; its details stay with subscriber readers.
Internal or unknown components, webhook URLs that are not public HTTPS, missing
scopes and revoked credentials are refused without a change. Phone numbers use
**Add subscriber** in the app.

Webhook endpoints choose **Lamp** or **Statuspage** as their body format. Lamp
is the default. Both formats use the same signature headers and delivery rules.
Statuspage bodies share the public API's status values and stable IDs, contain
the complete published incident update history, and preserve plain update text
and bare URLs. The recipient can change the format from their emailed management
link. CSV webhook rows can set optional `webhook_format` to `lamp` or `statuspage`.
Standalone component-change notifications remain with NOTIFY-017; the future
Statuspage webhook importer remains with MOVE-010. Maintenance carries the
existing notices; MAINT-009's unbuilt in-window wording remains a gap. The public
subscribe form's format chooser awaits the owner UI pass.

## Import and export subscribers

In **Subscribers → Import and export**, choose or paste a CSV and run its dry
run. This writes nothing and sends no mail. Review the created, skipped and
refused counts and each refusal reason, then create the pending subscriptions.
An owner must explicitly choose **Send invitations** to send up to 50
confirmation invitations per action; an invitation already sent is not repeated.
The columns are `email`, `phone`, `webhook_url`, `contact_email`, `components`
and `language`. Component IDs are separated by semicolons; an empty selection
follows all visible components. Existing subscriptions are skipped without
changing their state or selection. Files are limited to 8 MiB and 5,000 rows.
Phone rows are refused because SMS subscriptions are unavailable, and language
accepts only English (`en`). SUB-020 enforces 25,000 subscriptions across all channels, including at most
2,500 webhook endpoints and 1,000 Slack and Teams subscriptions together. Pending
and active subscriptions count; deactivated and deleted ones do not. An over-limit
dry run names and refuses the excess, and apply writes nothing until the file fits. **Export subscribers as CSV** includes channel, state,
components and the recorded confirmation time; unconfirmed rows have no consent
time. Spreadsheet formula-leading cells are neutralised on export.

An incoming webhook is a private address created by Slack or Teams for posting
messages to one channel. Slack and Teams posts need an outbound connection,
which Managed hosting does not offer yet; on Managed, the card says so and
accepts no channel. They work on Free and Assisted installations. Create it in that service first, then paste it into
Lamp. You need permission to add an app or workflow in the destination workspace.

### Create a Slack webhook

1. Open [Slack's app dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create an app for
   your workspace (or select an existing app).
2. In the app's **Incoming Webhooks** settings, turn on **Activate Incoming Webhooks**.
3. Choose **Add New Webhook to Workspace**, select the destination channel and
   authorize it. For a private channel, you must already be a member.
4. Copy the resulting webhook URL. See [Slack's complete incoming-webhook guide](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/)
   if your workspace requires an administrator's app approval.

### Create a Microsoft Teams webhook

1. In Teams, open **Workflows** and choose the **Send webhook alerts to a channel**
   template. Select the destination team and channel, then save it.
2. In the workflow's **When a Teams webhook request is received** trigger, set
   **Who can trigger the flow?** to **Anyone**. Lamp posts using the private URL;
   it does not provide Microsoft user authentication for tenant-only triggers.
3. Copy the webhook URL from the saved workflow's details. Keep the workflow
   active and assign a co-owner so it keeps working when its creator leaves.

See [Microsoft's template instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/workflows/send-messages-in-teams-using-incoming-webhooks?nochrome=true)
and [trigger authentication options](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/teams/).
Use Workflows for new connections; Microsoft is retiring the older connector
setup. If Workflows is unavailable, ask the Teams administrator to enable it.

### Save the channel in Lamp and check a post

In **Settings → Connected tools**, choose Slack or Microsoft Teams, enter a name
and paste that service's incoming webhook URL. Select the components it follows.
Leave every component unchecked to follow all visible components. The URL is encrypted and is not shown again after you
save it. Select **Slack and Teams** when publishing an update to post to the
matching channels.

Saving checks the address format and supported provider host; it sends
nothing. To check the connection, choose **Send test post** beside the saved
channel. Success: Lamp says the service accepted it, and a "Test post from
Lamp" message appears in that channel. The test is not an incident update and
is not recorded in **Recent posts**. Published updates appear there with the
service's response, which shows the post was accepted, not that someone read it.
If posting fails, check the copied URL, app/workflow permissions and workflow
status. For Teams, also check the **Anyone** trigger setting. Recreate the
webhook and remove/re-add the channel if its private URL was revoked or exposed.

Use the delivery log to review queued, delivered, bounced, complained,
suppressed or failed notifications and filter by channel, outcome or update.

For email, queued can mean the provider has already accepted the message. The
provider-accepted timestamp records that API response; it does not prove recipient
delivery. Without signed receipts configured, **Accepted by SendGrid** (or **Accepted by
Resend**) is the final email status shown for a successful send. The persisted
transport outcome remains queued; CSV includes the provider-accepted timestamp.
SendGrid receipts use `SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY` or the optional signed relay;
Resend uses `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Configure the selected provider's verification key
and signed webhook in [Owner inputs](../OPERATIONS.md#owner-inputs) to receive
delivered, bounced or complained updates. Delivered records the provider's
delivery report, never an open or proof that a person read the message.

## See the reach of an update

Open an incident's **Communication and reach** panel to see its whole-incident
figures. Expand **Reach of each update** for the recipient set and outcomes of
each publication. Email and webhook channels show committed sends, delivered,
bounced, complained, suppressed, failed and queued records. The panel refreshes
its own reads every 15 seconds while visible, including after publication;
refreshing counts leaves the update composer and its saved draft alone.

Committed sends count delivery rows. **Distinct subscribers delivered** counts
each opaque subscriber ID once per channel across the incident's updates. A
second update to the same ten subscribers adds ten sends, not ten additional
people. Erasing a destination preserves these anonymous counts. Operator Slack
and Teams destination posts appear separately and never increase subscriber
reach.

**Provider accepted sends** records successful provider-message attempts once
per delivery, even if there were retries. An email can be accepted and still be
queued until a signed delivery receipt arrives. Webhook delivery records its
endpoint's acknowledgment. Neither channel measures reading. Imported
historical updates have unknown source delivery figures; a mixed total labels
its known records as incomplete. **Download CSV** exports the same counts and
measurement definitions.

## Review communication performance

In **Settings → Reports**, use **Communication performance** to choose the calendar month
in the page's configured timezone. The cohort contains incidents opened from
the first instant of that local month, inclusive, to the next month's first
instant, exclusive. Their later publications and current delivery outcomes stay
with that opening month. Expand an incident for its individual figures, or open
its communication panel. The CSV includes raw counts, known timing totals,
averages, timezone and measurement time.

Alert-to-first-update latency starts at the first accepted alert receipt. A
manually opened incident without one has unknown alert latency. Native updates
use their actual publication record time, including later backdated updates;
imported updates retain the source's public timeline. Resolution duration runs
from incident opening to resolution; a later native backdated resolution cannot
shorten it to before the publication actually happened.

Each native public update with a next-update deadline makes one promise. The
next actual public publication keeps it when it happens at or before that
deadline. A late successor misses it. A promise with no successor stays pending
until its deadline passes, then counts as missed. Pending promises are excluded
from the kept share. Later backdating cannot turn a missed promise into a kept
one; imported source promises are unavailable.

The delivery failure rate divides bounced, complained and failed rows by all
known committed email/webhook rows, including queued and suppressed records.
The label gives that denominator; partial import coverage remains explicit.
Reports owed uses the existing report-due policy and the incident's retained
component-derived peak impact, independently of an operator-set impact override.
The default policy counts an unpublished report as owed seven days after a
Partially unavailable or Major outage incident resolves.

## Brand notification email

In Settings → Notification email, set your sender display name, reply-to address,
subject prefix, and plain-text header and footer. The From address remains your
configured, authenticated address. You can include a postal address in the footer.
Management and unsubscribe links and the required List headers are always added.
Upload a PNG, JPEG or WebP under Brand mark and select Use the uploaded page logo
in email; the HTML part loads it from your public status host, and the text part
carries no image reference. Other image URLs are not accepted.

Changes save automatically. Open an incident's Email preview to check the name,
reply-to, subject, logo and wording. An email already submitted for delivery keeps
its original branding during retries, even if you change Settings afterwards.

Managed mail controls From and Reply-To, so those two controls are disabled and
unsupported identity changes are refused. Subject prefixes, the logo and message
wording remain available. SendGrid and Resend support all these branding settings.

## Subscriber reporting

Open **Settings → Reports** for current counts by channel and state. Expand **Counts by component** or **Deactivation reasons** for detail. A subscription following every component appears in each component's count, so component counts overlap. Erased destinations are excluded.

Choose a growth month and channel, then **Download CSV** to export the same figures. The month filters the growth record; current counts always describe the present. Reports reads the figures again each time you open it.

Daily growth measures pending plus active subscriptions: a new pending subscription joins inventory, confirmation does not add it again, and deactivation or erasure leaves inventory. Dates use UTC. Tracking starts with the first subscriber change or report read, from the baseline displayed on the report; earlier daily changes are unknown. The first tracked day and the current day are incomplete. Technical backups retain this anonymous history; restoring an older archive starts a new baseline. Audience and language reporting are not yet available.

### Secondary email provider

Ordinary hosted deployments can select `mailgun` alongside `resend` and
`sendgrid`, `ses` and `postmark` through `MAIL_PROVIDER`. Mailgun uses the sender address's domain and
`MAILGUN_REGION` (`us` by default, or `eu`). Configure its dedicated
`MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY`, then register `/api/intake/mail-events/mailgun`
for signed delivery, bounce and complaint events. Mailgun requests disable open
and click tracking. A submission without a definite receipt is not resent
automatically.

A deployment may set `MAIL_SECONDARY_PROVIDER` to a different direct provider
and supply `MAIL_SECONDARY_API_KEY`. Both must already authenticate the same
From domain. Secondary delivery starts off; in **Settings → Notifications**,
choose the connected secondary provider to enable it, or **None** to disable it.
Five minutes of explicit retryable primary rejections permit the
secondary to receive the original envelope, with its unchanged Message-ID.
The delivery log and CSV name the accepting provider; restoring the primary
does not resend an accepted notification. An uncertain primary submission never
switches providers. Register each configured provider's signed event endpoint:
`/api/intake/mail-events/resend`, `/api/intake/mail-events/sendgrid`, or the
Mailgun endpoint above. Existing primary-only `/api/intake/mail-events` remains
available.

For SES, set `SES_REGION`, `SES_CONFIGURATION_SET` and the exact
`SES_EVENT_TOPIC_ARN` for its SNS event destination. The provider key is JSON with
`accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey` and an optional `sessionToken`. Configure that
SNS topic with signature version 2, and have its confirmed HTTPS subscription
post to `/api/intake/mail-events/ses`. Grant the sending key `GetConfigurationSet` and
`GetConfigurationSetEventDestinations` read access. Explicitly set that
configuration set’s VDM dashboard engagement metrics to **Disabled**; inherited,
unknown and enabled metrics are refused even when no event destination tracks
opens or clicks. Lamp refuses to send if any enabled
destination tracks opens or clicks, or if delivery, bounce and complaint events
are not connected to the configured SNS topic. Subscription confirmation is an owner
action; this intake never follows a confirmation URL.

Postmark uses a server token for sending and an optional separate
`POSTMARK_ACCOUNT_API_KEY` to read sender-domain DKIM status. Its event endpoint
is `/api/intake/mail-events/postmark`, with HTTPS Basic authentication: user
`lamp`, password `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Postmark offers authentication rather
than a native payload signature; this does not satisfy NOTIFY-013's signed-event
sentence.

Connecting provider credentials is deployment configuration; an owner selects
the connected secondary in Settings. Reported-outage switching is not built. An SES request carries the frozen
Message-ID, but SES documents replacing raw Message-ID headers: real
cross-provider preservation for SES remains unproven.
