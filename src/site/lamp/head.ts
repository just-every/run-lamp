// The landing page document head. Every file it names is bundled by Vite into /app-assets/; nothing is loaded from elsewhere.
// The font is imported with plain `?url` so the preload and fonts.css name one URL in development too; it is far
// above Vite's inline limit, so it is never a data: URL. The small icons need `no-inline`. The icons are mark 18's
// (scripts/lamp-site/mark.mjs): the SVG favicon, which shows the mark's reverse when the browser's chrome is dark, the
// 32 and 16px PNGs for browsers without SVG favicons, and the touch icon. The intro's three sprites are preloaded with
// the same AVIF srcset and sizes as their <source>s, so each loads once, before first paint needs it.
