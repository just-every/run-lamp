# Backups and recovery

Lamp gives you two kinds of copy:

- **Page data**, from the app: one JSON file with everything your status page
  holds. Download it any time from **Settings**, and restore it into a new Lamp,
  hosted or local, from the same place. No terminal needed.
- **A full archive**, from the terminal: every table, file and record of an
  installation, including sign-in and delivery records, for a like-for-like
  restore of a local or hosted installation.

## Export your page data from the app

Sign in and open **Settings → Export and restore → Download page data**. The file,
`lamp-page-data-<date>.json`, holds:

- page settings (name, tagline, color, time zone, footer credit, widget origins,
  AI tone) and the logo;
- component groups and components, with their current status and status history;
- incidents with every update, unpublished draft, internal note and post-incident
  report;
- maintenance windows with their notices;
- subscribers: email address or webhook, chosen components and consent state
  (subscribed, confirmed, or when and why they left);
- incident and maintenance reference numbers, so new ones continue from yours.

It leaves out operator sign-in and sessions, delivery logs, alert sources, Slack
and Teams channels, incident attachments, move-in history, and mail and AI
settings. The file holds your subscribers' addresses: keep it private.

### The file format

The file is JSON in Lamp's `lamp-page-data` format, version 1:

| Key | Holds |
|---|---|
| `format`, `version` | `"lamp-page-data"` and `1`. |
| `exportedAt`, `contents` | When it was made, and a sentence naming what it holds. |
| `page` | `pageName`, `tagline`, `accentColor`, `timezone`, `footerCreditEnabled`, `widgetAllowedOrigins`, `aiToneInstructions`, `feedId` (your Atom feed's identity) and `logo` (`contentType` and `base64` bytes, or `null`). |
| `people` | `email` and `displayName` of each operator who wrote or reviewed a record. |
| `records` | One list of rows per Lamp table, keyed by table name, with each row's columns as Lamp stores them: `component_groups`, `components`, `component_standing_claims`, `component_claim_events`, `component_state_history`, `component_state_corrections`, `incidents`, `incident_components`, `incident_updates`, `incident_drafts`, `incident_internal_notes`, `incident_reports`, `maintenance`, `maintenance_components`, `maintenance_notices`, `import_maintenance_updates`, `subscribers`, `subscriber_components`, `reference_allocations` and `reference_counters`. |
| `integrity` | `algorithm` (`"HMAC-SHA256"`) and `value`: a keyed hash of everything else in the file. Its key is derived from the exporting installation's `SUBSCRIBER_TOKEN_SECRET` and never leaves it. Files from Lamp 1.7.0 and earlier have no `integrity`. |

Rows name their author, and a draft its reviewer, by email (`operator_email`,
`created_by_email`, `author_email`, `reviewed_by_email`) instead of an
installation's operator ID. Each subscriber row
adds `confirmed_at`, the time they confirmed by email, or `null`; its `state` is
`pending`, `active` or `deactivated`, with `deactivation_reason` and
`deactivated_at` for someone who left.

### Restore page data into a new Lamp

Restore into a new installation before you add components, incidents,
maintenance or subscribers to it: a local one (`rer dev`) or a hosted one
([Deploy to Cloudflare](deploy.md)), after its first sign-in. Open **Settings →
Restore page data**, choose the file and **Check file**: Lamp counts what the
file holds and says whether this page can take it, without writing anything.
Then choose **Restore page data**. It restores everything in one step or nothing
at all, and rebuilds the public page. If anyone adds a record to the page while
it runs, the restore stops and writes nothing.

The restore itself emails nobody. Links in emails the old page sent stop
working; every later email carries new ones. Webhook
subscribers verify signatures with the new installation's signing secret. Authors
who are not operators on the new page are listed as former operators: their
records keep their name, and they cannot sign in unless you invite them.

#### Subscribers and consent

Email subscribers keep their state (subscribed, pending, or when and why they
left) only when the new installation can check the file's `integrity` value
itself. That works when the file is unchanged and the new installation holds
the same `SUBSCRIBER_TOKEN_SECRET` as the one that exported it: the same
installation, or a recovery given its [signing secrets](#restore-a-hosted-installation).
Afterwards a fresh **Download page data** gives back the same file, apart from
`exportedAt` and `integrity`.

Otherwise each email subscriber who was subscribed or pending is held: a file
edited by hand, a file from another installation with its own secret, and a file
from Lamp 1.7.0 or earlier. This rule is the same hosted and on Managed hosting.
It is the double opt-in every other import keeps: an address shows consent only
by following a link this page emailed it. **Check file** says how many
subscribers will be held, before anything is written. Held subscribers receive
nothing. Under **Restore page data**, **Send confirmation emails** sends each of
them one confirmation; whoever follows its link within 72 hours is subscribed
again, and the rest are deleted as unconfirmed. Held subscribers you never send
one to are deleted, address and all, 30 days after the restore. Webhook
subscribers are restored as they were: a webhook endpoint has no confirmation
step anywhere in Lamp.

Scheduled updates and maintenance in the file carry on as scheduled. Any that
fell due between the export and the restore run within a minute of it and notify
the subscribers who kept their state.

## Back up a hosted installation

These commands run on Node 22 or later. Check with `node --version`; if it is
missing or older (the Run page's installer keeps its Node private to `rer`),
install Node 22 from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or your package
manager and open a new terminal. Run them from the Lamp folder that deployed the
installation, with its environment name and [private input file](deploy.md#step-1-make-a-private-input-file),
after `rer install`:

```sh
node scripts/export.mjs --remote --environment production --env-file "$LAMP_DEPLOY_ENV" --out "$HOME/lamp-backups/production-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
```

With `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` exported in the shell,
`rer export --target remote --output "$HOME/lamp-backups/production-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"`
runs the same command for the `production` installation and names the folder
and exit status when it finishes.

It writes a new folder holding every database table, every stored file with its
metadata, and a `manifest.json` with checksums and the migrations the data needs.
The folder must not exist yet or be empty. Keep it private: it holds subscriber
addresses, sessions and sent mail. Pause operator work while it runs; the
database is read in one transaction, but files are copied after it. Keep your
input file and [its signing secrets](deploy.md#after-the-first-deploy)
with the archive.

## Restore a hosted installation

A full archive restores into a new, empty installation, never over a running
one. Give it a new environment name, such as `recovery`, and its own input file
with the original signing secrets, so emailed subscriber links and operator
sessions keep working. From the Lamp folder that deployed the original:

```sh
cp "$HOME/.config/lamp/production.env" "$HOME/.config/lamp/recovery.env"
cat .rer/deploy/production.secrets.env >> "$HOME/.config/lamp/recovery.env"
```

Skip the second line if your input file already holds `SESSION_SECRET`,
`SUBSCRIBER_TOKEN_SECRET` and `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` (a name may appear only
once). Then edit `recovery.env` and set the new installation's two addresses
([step 3](deploy.md#step-3-your-two-addresses), with `recovery` in place of
`production`). Restore and publish:

```sh
node scripts/setup.mjs --environment recovery --env-file "$HOME/.config/lamp/recovery.env" --restore-from "$HOME/lamp-backups/production-20261017-0930"
rer deploy --environment recovery --env-file "$HOME/.config/lamp/recovery.env"
```

The first command creates the new database, storage and queue, checks the
archive's checksums and migrations, and imports it; it never publishes Lamp and
refuses a destination that already holds data. The second publishes the restored
installation. Sign in, check the public page and a publication, then move your
addresses or DNS to it. Keep the old installation running until you have. If a
restore stops part-way, keep the archive and restore into another new
environment name; do not route visitors to the partial one.

## Back up and restore a local installation

Use the [local backup and restore sequence](../RUN-LOCALLY.md#back-up-and-restore-local-data)
(`rer export` and `rer import`). Stop a running development server with
`rer dev --stop` or a running preview with `rer preview --stop` before exporting,
transferring an archive or resetting data. Export before reset, import only into
an empty destination, then run `rer setup` with the original or restored owner's
email before restarting Lamp. `rer export` and `rer import` work on the local
installation only; the commands above cover a hosted one.

The [operations reference](../OPERATIONS.md#portable-backups-and-restore) has
the technical details of the archive.

## Retire a hosted installation

Back up first, and keep your private input file. Then use Lamp's
[removal command](deploy.md#remove-an-installation) from the folder that
deployed it, with the same environment. It removes both Workers in `workers.dev`
mode and the resources its creation records prove it owns. The generic
`rer deploy --remove --yes` alone leaves the separate public page Worker. Older
installations without creation records need the [manual removal limits and procedure](deployment-reference.md#removal-and-deployment-records).
