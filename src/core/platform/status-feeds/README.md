# Status page feeds

Reads a public status page through its vendor's own public feeds, without a key:
its components and groups in the page's order, and its past incidents with every
update. For Atlassian Statuspage, Instatus and Better Stack. Self-contained beside
the site reader (its fetch guard, text and name cleaning), no Lamp imports, standard
`fetch` only, runs in Workers and Node.

```ts
import { readStatusFeeds } from "./index.ts";

const read = await readStatusFeeds("https://status.example.com/", "statuspage");
if (read) read.page;   // StatusFeedPage; read.files are the responses, unchanged
```

## What each vendor publishes

| Vendor | Components and groups | History |
|---|---|---|
| Statuspage | `/api/v2/summary.json`: a component marked `group` is a group, listing its own | `/api/v2/incidents.json`: the 50 newest incidents, each update with the component states it set |
| Instatus | `/summary.json` (name, what is open now) and `/v2/components.json`: a component others name as their group is that group | `/history.atom`: each incident's updates and the components it affected, by name; no states, and no year on an update's time (taken from the entry's own times) |
| Better Stack | `/index.json`: named sections are groups; one section alone is the page's list | the reports `/index.json` shows, with each update's resource states, and older ones from the `/feed` RSS, one item per update, naming resources only in their titles |

`StatusFeedPage.incidents` holds only resolved incidents: anything still open on the
page and all maintenance are left out. A Better Stack report no longer on the page is
over. `components` lists only what the page names; states appear only where the feed
states them. A page ID is the page's own (Statuspage's, or Better Stack's when the page
says this is its address). `address` is the address the page gives as its own (its
page URL, or Better Stack's custom domain) and `homepage` the business's site where the
feeds give it (Better Stack's company URL), so a reader can tell whose page it is.

Component names are the page's own. The site reader's cleaning takes off decoration
(spacing, emoji, entities) but never a word: "HTTP (Preview)" stays whole.

## Safety and limits

Every request is a keyless `GET` to the page's own origin at the vendor's fixed path,
through the site reader's guard (public addresses only, on every redirect hop, DNS over
HTTPS by default). One deadline covers a read (8 s by default). A summary or component
list is read up to 1 MB, a history feed or Better Stack index up to 3 MB, and a larger
one is refused. A page whose history does not answer still gives its components.

Tests: `tests/site-reader/site-reader.test.mjs` (discovery and reading, against the real
captures in `tests/fixtures/status-feeds/`), and Move in's readers of those captures in
`tests/betterstack/reader.test.mjs` and `tests/instatus/reader.test.mjs`.
