# Lamp

Lamp is a self-hosted status page and incident communication desk for one
business. The operator app manages components, incidents, maintenance and
subscriber communication; its separate page host serves customer-facing status
information.

## Run it locally

```sh
npx -y @runeditrun/rer dev just-every/run-lamp
```

That one line gets Lamp, installs everything, makes you the owner and prints a link
that opens Lamp signed in. To start it again later, run `cd run-lamp && rer dev`.
No Node? `curl -fsSL https://runeditrun.com/install.sh | sh -s -- dev just-every/run-lamp`
brings its own and does the same.

## Owner guides

The app host serves Lamp's public documentation at `/docs`. Start with the
[overview](docs/overview.md), then choose a task:

- [Install](docs/install.md) or [run Lamp locally](RUN-LOCALLY.md).
- [First-run setup](docs/first-run.md), [components and groups](docs/components-and-groups.md),
  [incidents and updates](docs/incidents-and-updates.md), and [maintenance](docs/maintenance.md).
- [Public page](docs/public-page.md), [subscribers and notifications](docs/subscribers-and-notifications.md),
  [monitoring alerts](docs/alerts-from-monitoring-tools.md), [AI assistance](docs/ai-assistance.md),
  and [operators](docs/operators-and-sign-in.md).
- [Domains](docs/domains.md), [move-in](docs/moving-in.md),
  [backups and recovery](docs/backups-and-recovery.md), and [updating](docs/updating.md).

## Source and tooling versions

The Run page's start line, `npx -y @runeditrun/rer dev just-every/run-lamp`, clones the default branch, `main`, not a release tag, into a `run-lamp`
folder and starts it; after that, run `rer dev` from that folder. `main` is Lamp's
development source and may hold changes not yet in a release; it pins
`@runeditrun/rer` 0.2.98. The latest tagged release is `v1.11.8`, which pins
`@runeditrun/rer` 0.2.98 too. To use that release instead, clone the tag and start it:

```sh
git clone --branch v1.11.8 https://github.com/just-every/run-lamp.git lamp
cd lamp && rer dev
```

Then follow the documentation inside that checkout, which matches its tools.

`rer --version` prints the `rer` you installed on its first line and the version
this checkout pins on its second. Inside the checkout every `rer` command runs the
pinned version once the checkout's dependencies are installed (`rer dev` and
`rer install` install them); the installed `rer` only starts it.

Node 22.20.0 and pnpm 10.12.4 are pinned. `rer` downloads and uses that Node
version when your shell has a different one, and says so when it starts. Every
command in the guides runs through `rer`, except
[removing a deployment](docs/deploy.md#remove-an-installation) and
[backing up or restoring a hosted one](docs/backups-and-recovery.md#back-up-a-hosted-installation),
which need Node 22 or later on your PATH (no global pnpm).

## Deploy and verify

- **Free:** you run Lamp's open source yourself in your own Cloudflare account,
  with no Run Edit Run charge. The commands in this guide are this path.
- **Assisted:** Run Edit Run installs and maintains Lamp for you, while it stays
  in your own Cloudflare account and GitHub repository (early access).
- **Managed:** Run Edit Run hosts and runs Lamp for you (waitlist only).

Compare them on [Run Edit Run plans](https://runeditrun.com/pricing).

Managed hosting includes mail: you need no provider account or mail key. RER
fills and hides `MAIL_PROVIDER=rer`, `MAIL_FROM`, `MAIL_RELAY_URL` and the private
`MAIL_API_KEY`. Free and Assisted hosting keep your own Resend or SendGrid account,
authenticated sender and API key, using `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, `MAIL_DKIM_SELECTOR`
and `MAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY`. Every hosted installation needs working mail.
[Deploy to Cloudflare](docs/deploy.md) is one guided page: it explains each input
in the order the dry run asks for it, including how to authenticate a sending
domain at SendGrid or Resend, and keeps them in a private
[input file](docs/deploy.md#step-1-make-a-private-input-file).
You can also export the input names in the calling shell. The
[input reference](docs/deployment-reference.md) distinguishes required owner
values from secrets that `rer` generates on a first deploy.

Use `rer` from the project root; the checkout pins `@runeditrun/rer` 0.2.98. Before a
command that builds or verifies the checkout,
stop a running development server with `rer dev --stop` or a production preview
with `rer preview --stop`.

```sh
rer deploy --dry-run --environment production --env-file "$HOME/.config/lamp/production.env"
rer deploy --environment production --env-file "$HOME/.config/lamp/production.env"
```

The dry run validates and compiles locally without contacting Cloudflare. A
deployment validates owner inputs, provisions or reuses resources, applies
migrations, builds and uploads the Worker with secrets, and checks application health.
Run `rer verify` separately for the full source and browser checks; deployment does
not run the verifier. The deploy ends by naming the sign-in address (your
`LAMP_APP_HOST`). Use the same environment on later deploys.
For terminal entry to the hosted owner account, use
`rer signin --environment production --env-file "$HOME/.config/lamp/production.env"`
from the deploying checkout with the default `lamp-<environment>` resource prefix.
It prints a private, single-use link without sending email; see
[terminal sign-in](docs/operators-and-sign-in.md#terminal-entry-for-the-hosted-owner)
for custom prefixes and other prerequisites.
To retire an installation, see the [removal command and record limits](docs/deploy.md#remove-an-installation).

Before `rer verify`, stop the active development server or production preview
with the corresponding command above. A passing source verifier does not
establish hosted readiness or provider delivery; record each installation's
acceptance evidence separately in [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md).

## Your own domain

The public and operator hosts must be distinct. See [Hostnames and your own domain](docs/domains.md)
for Cloudflare zone and DNS steps.

- [CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md) defines Lamp's product behavior; [BASELINE.md](BASELINE.md)
  holds the shared security and data guarantees.
- [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) is the technical reference for Cloudflare
  provisioning, remote archives and recovery. Local data recovery uses the
  [canonical local sequence](RUN-LOCALLY.md#back-up-and-restore-local-data).

Preserve applied migration history. Back up data and the source revision before
an update, restore into an empty destination when needed, and verify the exact
candidate before adoption.
