# Components and groups

Open **Components** in the operator app. Add components for the services
customers need to see, then add groups in **Edit all** when you want to
organize those services on the public page.

## Set up components

1. Choose **Add component** and enter its public name. Add an optional public
   description and state note, then choose a group or leave it ungrouped.
2. Check **Hidden from the public page** when a component should stay off the
   public page, Atom feed, widget, overall status and uptime figures. Its row
   then reads **Internal only**.
3. Set the displayed order with **Position** in **Edit all**. A component can
   belong to at most one group.
4. Choose a component's row to open its panel on **Details**, where you edit or
   delete it. In **Status**, set a standing operator status, or choose
   **Automatic** to clear that claim. Active incidents and in-progress
   maintenance can also claim a state; the public state is the most severe
   current claim.
5. In **History**, review state changes, or open **Correct a past period** to
   record a correction with its reason.

Group order and component order are reflected on the public page. Deleting a
component removes its public state history and uptime, while published incident
and maintenance updates keep its recorded name.

Public descriptions accept up to 500 characters and appear behind an **About**
disclosure that works without JavaScript. Set **Uptime start date** to exclude
earlier days from the displayed uptime calculation while keeping their history.
Choose **Show only when not Operational** for a service that customers need to
see only while affected. Its claims still count toward overall status. Recovery
hides its component row and uptime again without deleting either record.

## Edit the catalog together

Choose **Edit all** to edit component and group rows together; it is where
groups are added, renamed, reordered and removed. Change names, descriptions,
positions, groups, visibility or uptime dates, and add or remove rows. Choose
**Review changes** to see the counts and deletions; the dry run writes nothing.
**Apply reviewed changes** commits that catalog. A concurrent edit makes the
review stale, so choose **Reload** and review again.

**Import CSV** accepts a file or pasted contents. The required header is `name`;
**CSV format** lists the optional headers. Quote descriptions containing commas,
quotes or newlines. Rows without an ID add components; rows naming an existing
ID change it. Existing components stay unless an identified row says
`action=delete`. New group names create groups. Review before applying.

## Download availability reports

Open a component's panel and choose **History**. Under **Availability report**,
choose a calendar month or quarter in the page's time zone, then
**Download CSV** or **Download PDF**. Each report lists
claimed uptime, weighted downtime minutes, incidents whose component claims
intersect the period, and maintenance windows with their recorded states.

The percentage uses the public page's state-history weights and corrections.
Maintenance has zero downtime weight. Current periods stop at the report time;
future time and time before tracking began are not counted. No history is
reported as **No data**. A configured uptime start date and the report period's
boundaries both use the page's time zone. Monitor-measured figures and
private audience sharing are not available yet.
