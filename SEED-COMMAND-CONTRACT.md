# Seed command contract 1

To bring existing data into a seed, sign in as the owner and use its import
screen. First step: open this path on the destination app:

```text
/app/import
```

Upload a supported source export, review the plan and its differences, then
approve that exact plan to apply it. Reconcile the result against native data;
use Undo from the same history when needed. Base's reference accepts people JSON
here, not installation `.rer` archives. Editions adopt this same door
with their own supported readers and native adapters.

This is the required maintained command path for every first-party seed,
including Base's default seed and composed foundation editions. Independently
authored projects may use this CLI and installer, but RER does not require
either; owners keep their own supported operations and integration choices.

## One data import door

Owner move-in uses the signed-in `/app/import` screen and
`POST /api/operator/import/{uploads,plan,apply,status,reconcile,undo}` with native
session, Origin and CSRF checks. Upload original bytes, show the plan's counts,
rejections and differences, and apply only its reviewed fingerprint. Reconcile
from native data and expose history and Undo from this same pipeline. RER and
Business import automation use that door's grant mount with their declared
authority; they must not create a second importer. Follow Base's
[door adoption guide](https://github.com/runeditrun/base/blob/main/modules/import-kit/src/door/ADOPTING.md).
The technical foundation needs a product reader, native adapter and screen
before it offers data move-in.

The required `export` and `import` verbs below retain their existing archive
contract to back up and restore this installation. Archive restore is
separate from reviewed source import: it requires an empty destination and has
no door plan or Undo. The reference door accepts people JSON source exports,
not `.rer` archives; do not imply that `rer import --input` uses the door.

## Runtime Business settings adoption

Seeds that take Business name, logo, timezone, app accent or team changes
while running follow the [Business settings adoption recipe](../modules/business-settings/ADOPTING.md).
Declare the optional `rer-setup.json` `business` block only for slots the seed
renders at runtime. Integrate the signed settings door, its D1 migration,
native team authority and owner overrides; declaring metadata alone does not
adopt the feature. Logo uses the same-origin document route, never a
`businessField: "logo_ref"` environment input. Keep the Business accent inside
the signed-in app shell and preserve approved public pages and product marks.
The recipe documents source-copy dependencies, mail display-name integration
and the assembled-seed checks; it does not promise a package export.

## Local Business carry

The installed rer carries the paired Business into each first-party checkout at
`.rer/local/business.json`. The folder is 0700 and the file is 0600. Writes use a
temporary file and atomic rename. A refresh with unchanged values leaves the file
byte-identical, including `refreshed_at`, which records when the carried values
last changed.

```json
{"version":1,"origin":"https://billing-qualification.runeditrun.com","business_id":"<id>","business_url":"https://billing-qualification.runeditrun.com/business/<id>","name":"Example Business Co","legal_name":null,"accent":"#264f45","logo_url":null,"refreshed_at":"<ISO time>"}
```

`origin` is the paired state origin. `business_id` must match that state's
Business id; `business_url` is the origin plus `/business/` plus the id encoded
with `encodeURIComponent`. `name` has 1 to 200 characters. `legal_name` is a
string or null. `accent` is the profile's `brand_color` as lower case `#rrggbb`,
or null; `logo_url` is HTTPS or null. A missing Business block or a mismatched
id writes nothing. An unavailable or refusing platform preserves the file;
launch continues. Connect and re-connect refresh live first-party checkouts;
setup and dev refresh their checkout before its pinned rer runs. Business run
refreshes live checkouts at start, including `--once`, and at most once a minute.
Disconnect removes carries from recorded and live checkouts.

These values are prefills and display only, never authority. Never overwrite a
value the owner saved. A legal-name prefill uses `legal_name ?? name`.
Seeds read and validate this JSON only under `vite dev`, as one plain binding
`RER_BUSINESS` holding the validated JSON. Exclude it from build output and never
read or bind it when `RER_DEMO=1`. Seeds restart their dev server when the carry
file is added, changed or removed.

## Browser-free agent check

After the pinned `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, run `pnpm run verify:agent`.
The default seed and foundation export template run, in order: `build` (generates
route/build inputs before checking types), `typecheck`, `source:check` (offline,
frozen dependency-lock validation, with install scripts disabled), then
`verify:base-source` (`rer check --profile first-party`: the command contract,
recorded CLI/onboarding source inventory and recorded auth-copy custody).
These templates have no edition-authoring source lock to refresh. An edition
that adds one must declare `source:lock` and refresh it after its build and
before checking it in `source:check`; never refresh custody records to hide drift.
Platform recognizes `verify:agent` ahead of `verify:fast`, and also runs declared
source/custody checks separately. No browser or external network is needed after
the pinned install. This is not runtime, browser, migration, deployment or full
product verification: full `rer verify` stays in trusted CI.

## Commands and flags

Run from the project root, or use `--cwd PATH`. Every new verb accepts `--help`, `--cwd PATH`, `--non-interactive` and `--json`. Help exits before tools, configuration, adapters or effects run. Unknown flags, missing flag values and invalid values fail before effects. A single `--` separator is accepted for package-script forwarding. Flags belong only to the verbs listed below; there is no catch-all pass-through in the first-party profile.

| Required verb | Additional flags | Successful end state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `install` | `--no-queue` | Frozen dependency installation using the pinned pnpm and lockfile; no app setup, global tool changes or deployment. |
| `setup` | `--owner-email EMAIL`, `--owner-name NAME`, `--port P`, `--host HOST`, `--answers FILE`, `--door`, `--no-queue` | Manifest answers validated; real build, all local migrations, private settings and first owner prepared; temporary app stopped before exit. `--door` sets a fresh checkout up at its front-door origin `http://NAME.localhost:PORT` once `rer door enable` has run. |
| `dev` | `--detach`, `--foreground`, `--port P`, `--host HOST`, `--idle-timeout SECONDS`, `--stop`, `--as PERSONA`, `--login`, `--door`, `--direct`, `--demo`, `--no-queue` | Managed foreground development server with assets/HMR, health-gated readiness and the project's declared Cron Triggers run locally on their schedule (`commandAdapter` option `scheduled: false` turns that off). The Cron Triggers are read from every file the deployed-Worker check reads: `devIdentity.deployConfig` when declared, else `wrangler.jsonc`, `wrangler.json`, `wrangler.toml` (unless `generatedOutputs` lists it) and deploy templates such as `deploy/wrangler.template.toml`. Two of those files that both declare `triggers.crons` must declare the same ones, or the command refuses with one line naming both files and their crons. A seed declaring `devIdentity` opens signed in as the owner `rer setup` claimed; `--as` starts as another declared persona or `signed-out`, and legacy `--login` uses the same automatic sign-in. A checkout whose saved origin is a front-door origin serves on `127.0.0.1` behind the machine's door; `--door` moves a direct checkout there and `--direct` moves it back, rewriting only the saved origin; `--port` and `--host` always serve directly. `--demo` (also spelled `rer demo`) serves a throwaway demo on fresh state in `.rer/demo/START/` (deleted when it stops: `--stop`, Ctrl-C, or its end, one hour by default or `--idle-timeout`), signed in as the saved owner, with the seed's demo data, real public reads/checks and simulated external writes; see `DEMO.md`. |
| `preview` | `--port P`, `--host HOST`, `--idle-timeout SECONDS`, `--stop`, `--detach`, `--foreground`, `--no-queue` | Managed production output; `--detach` returns after actual health readiness, leaving the server running until `--stop` or idle timeout. `--foreground` stays serving. Changes to built assets refresh the manifest and ETags; no source rebuild runs. Same owner and canonical durable state, and the same local Cron Triggers as `dev` (the seed's `preview` target receives `scheduled: true` and must start its runtime with Miniflare's trigger handler, `unsafeTriggerHandlers`, which the shared `previewTarget` does). |
| `build` | `--site`, `--no-queue` | With `--site`, the static run site (see Installed homepage and run site) written to the declared folder, checked and named in the output; a seed without a declared run site refuses with exit 4 before any effect. Otherwise: real production Worker/assets built with private local settings excluded, then restored exactly. A `devIdentity` seed's build fails with exit 4, naming the file, when its output contains the dev layer's marker. |
| `verify` | `--no-queue` | The seed's complete verification command runs; it never calls its own public `verify` alias recursively. Then its production build is served on loopback as `rer deploy` hosts it (see Hosted assets and deploy identity); verify fails, listing each path, when a built file does not answer 200 or `/health` lacks the deploy identity. Then Chromium loads each public page of that served build and verify fails, naming the page, case, section and evidence, when page sections do not hydrate as separate units (see Hydration units). |
| `reset` | `--yes` | Explicitly confirmed local data, owner, generated settings and installer state removed; no remote effect. |
| `deploy` | `--environment NAME`, `--owner-name NAME`, `--dry-run`, `--site`, `--no-queue` | With `--site`, the run site on its Base-generated site Worker (assets, plus the www-to-apex 301) with its custom domains (see Installed homepage and run site); with `--dry-run` it builds the site and prints the plan with zero provider requests. Otherwise: Base deploy-kit owner-account deployment plus health (the deploy identity, then one built file must answer 200); dry run builds and validates locally and prints target names, binding names and migration names. No credentials are needed, no Cloudflare requests occur and nothing changes remotely. Target secrets, permissions and remote readiness remain unchecked until a real deploy. Default environment is `production`. Both refuse with exit 4, before building, a deploy binding, secret or secret source named `RER_DEV_KEY` or any key the adapter declares in `localOnlyKeys`; deploy-kit's owner plan refuses the same. A deploy that is not a dry run also refuses with exit 4, before building, tracked files with uncommitted changes, naming them. |
| `export` | `--target local\|remote`, `--output FILE`, `--origin URL`, `--session-file FILE`, `--no-queue` | Complete supported installation data of the local copy written to a new owner-only archive, with integrity receipt and explicit exclusions; the closing line says which copy it exported. Default target is local; local output is required. A declared `portability.hostedExport` runs the seed's own hosted-export argv for `--target remote` (see the hook below). Otherwise `--origin` or `--target remote` names the hosted install: unless the adapter declares remote portability, export refuses (exit 2) before any effect, saves nothing, and names the `npx wrangler d1 export DATABASE --remote --output exports/DATABASE.sql` command for each database the checkout deployed. A declared `prepareData` hook runs first and the path is checked against the app's served folders after it, so a checkout that never built still completes when its Vite configuration needs a file `prepareData` generates. |
| `import` | `--target local\|remote`, `--input FILE`, `--journal FILE`, `--origin URL`, `--session-file FILE`, `--yes`, `--legacy-v1`, `--acknowledge-unverified-metadata`, `--acknowledge-unverified-schema-objects`, `--output FILE`, `--no-queue` | Archive validated and atomically restored into an empty destination under the product's restore policy; input and confirmation are required. Normal import requires v2; `--journal` (local only) names a later archive of the same installation, whose erasure journal also fences the restore. Backup-only local Workers v1 recovery requires both legacy flags and a new v2 output; it refuses `--journal` rather than ignoring it. See modules/portability/README.md#backup-only-v1-recovery. A v2 archive without `schemaObjects` restores without acknowledgment when its nonempty recorded migrations replay from destination files to the complete destination schema identity and the archived table definitions. Otherwise it still requires explicit `--acknowledge-unverified-schema-objects`, an empty destination and compatible destination migration history. Structure comes only from destination migrations; the normal confirmation, authentication and erasure fences remain. An acknowledged recovery receipt records `schemaUnverified` with archive identity and acknowledgment time; a verified restore records no such uncertainty. A fresh export from current rer is preferred; current archives restore without acknowledgment. A declared `prepareData` hook runs first, so a copy that never ran setup or build can import. |
| `doctor` | none | Read-only tool/version, local configuration and state-placement diagnostics, naming missing inputs and their documented sources, plus `warnings` for leftover Node quarantine copies, mismatched Node/pnpm/workerd pins across running checkouts and a checkout on another volume (warnings never change the exit code). No provider request. |
| `describe` | none | Describes commands, flags, aliases, effects, pins and state without installing or executing project commands. |
| `check` | `--profile first-party` | Read-only structural contract/operations validation, including required hooks, flags, aliases and pins. No credentials needed for a fresh clone. |
| `release` | existing `--repo`, `--project`, `--repository`, `--output`, `--ref`, `--public-base`, `--dry-run`, `--local-verify`, `--verify-workflow NAME_OR_FILE`, `--tag [vVERSION]`, `--clean-history`, `--onto`, `--env-file`, `--no-queue` | Existing Base release behavior, receipts, validation, gates, local tags and exit codes preserved. |

`signin` is rer's own verb, not a seed operation: no seed declares it and `check` does not ask for it. `rer signin [--environment NAME] [--env-file FILE]` gives the hosted owner a one-time sign-in link without mail when the seed uses operator-auth's `accounts/schema/owner-signin.sql` migration. It uses only the Cloudflare credentials that deployed that environment, writes a single-use grant for the recorded owner into the deployment's auth D1, and prints the link once to the terminal (never to a log or receipt). The link expires within 15 minutes and its use is recorded in the owner's audit log. Those seeds document `rer signin` in their README as the way into a hosted install whose mail is not working yet; after it, the owner corrects a wrong email in settings (`POST /auth/email`). A seed with native sign-in can declare its browser page with the `commandAdapter` option `signInPath: '/login'` (a same-origin path, not a magic-link API endpoint). When the owner sign-in table is absent, `rer signin` explains that the seed uses its own sign-in flow and points to that page on the recorded environment's origin, or to `/setup` for owner recovery when no page is declared. It exits 4 and issues no link.

`release` is the compatibility exception: preserve its existing parser, required `--repo`/`--output`, JSON receipt and exit codes; do not retrofit the new common flags or infer publishing identities. Root help may list the new commands. Release never pushes or deploys. A refused release prints the underlying message (a malformed `CONTRACT.md` names its file and line) on stderr and exits 2. Source inspection and locking use the package's edition-authoring implementation. `rer adopt-edition` and `rer refresh-base --ref FULL_COMMIT` are rer-owned source commands, declared through the same bootstrap contract; seeds do not add adapter hooks or OPERATIONS entries for them. See `EDITION-AUTHORING.md` for effects, acquisition, offline refusal and JSON fields.

For GitHub sources, `release` selects its verification workflow in this order:
`--verify-workflow NAME_OR_FILE`; optional top-level `verifyWorkflow` in the
selected commit's `rer-project.json` (for example `"verifyWorkflow": "Verify Slate"`
or `"verifyWorkflow": ".github/workflows/slate.yml"`); the workflow at
`.github/workflows/verify.yml` or `.github/workflows/verify.yaml`; then exactly
one workflow named `verify`. Names, full file paths and file basenames match
case-insensitively. Explicit selections must resolve uniquely; they never fall
through. Multiple conventional files or matching names are refused with the
candidates and `--verify-workflow` remedy. This optional declaration does not
change `operations.verify`, the seed's local command.

The selected workflow must have a completed successful run whose `head_sha`
equals the source commit exactly, with both `repository.full_name` and
`head_repository.full_name` matching the source repository, and its event must
be `push` or `workflow_dispatch`. Any branch of that repository can qualify.
These events run that commit's own workflow file on that commit's tree.
Pull-request runs test a merge ref and cannot serve as exact-SHA evidence, even
for a same-repository PR. Forks, other events and different SHAs cannot qualify.
Release-tag runs still require the tag to resolve remotely to that commit. A
failed tag lookup disqualifies that tag run; a separate qualifying run can still
authorize release.
The highest qualifying run ID is chosen deterministically. Failed or unfinished
duplicates are informational entries in the receipt and do not invalidate a
qualifying success.
`gates.verify` in the receipt and site provenance records `workflowFile`,
`workflowName`, `workflowId`, `runId`, `runUrl`, branch, event and conclusion.
When no run qualifies, the refusal names unfinished runs and advises pushing
the exact commit to any branch of the source repository and waiting for its
selected Verify workflow to complete successfully. `--local-verify` explicitly
runs frozen installation and the seed's local verification targets instead,
only when the source repository's verification policy permits it.

For a tag-first patch release from an already public source, push the branch,
create `git -c tag.gpgSign=false tag -a --cleanup=verbatim v<version> <exact-source-sha> -m "$release_message"`, push that
tag, wait for its selected Verify workflow to finish green on that SHA, then run
`rer release --repo DIR --ref <exact-source-sha> --tag v<version> --project PUBLISHER/NAME --repository GITHUB_URL --output NEW_DIR`.
Build `release_message` from the selected commit: the version tag alone, or the
tag followed by two newlines and trimmed `RELEASE.json.publicReleaseNotes` when
present. Notes must be nonempty text. The annotation must match that verbatim
message followed by exactly one newline. `modules/release/README.md` in Base
has the shell recipe.

The producer may adopt that remote annotated tag only when it directly targets
the selected commit, its embedded name and requested tag both equal the committed
version tag, and its annotation message bytes match the generated message.
Lightweight or nested tags and differing commits, names or messages are refused;
existing tags are never rewritten. The producer captures one immutable object
and direct source commit, checks the staged and imported identities before tag
mutation and before reporting RELEASED, and refuses if any tag changed. The
receipt retains the adopted tag object ID.
This changes neither the exact-SHA GitHub Verify gate nor the other release gates.

Every release, including an unchanged stable patch, validates the selected
commit's `CONTRACT.md` with the current parser. Predecessor tags cannot authorize
inheritance: existing release records contain no authenticated fresh contract
PASS to inherit. Older contracts need a current-format refresh before release.
The catalogue reads the validated contract's published clauses.

`--no-queue` is available only on the heavy commands that list it and only
when the original caller has `CI=true`. The actual descriptor is authoritative
for a given checkout.

Base default-seed and exported foundation typechecks in `verify` use checkout-local, gitignored `.cache/typecheck.tsbuildinfo` in the package; deleting it forces a full check, while `build` still builds the real Worker and assets.

`P` is a decimal integer 1–65535. An explicit occupied port fails; never silently choose another. Default port is the saved local port; a first `setup` with no `--port` saves the first free port from 8787 (free on every address, never a port another process listens on) and prints it in one line. `HOST` is exactly `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `::1`; default is saved host, otherwise the adapter's `host`, otherwise `127.0.0.1`. Public/listen-all hosts fail. First setup saves the selected origin. Dev/preview overrides apply together to runtime bindings and never rewrite private settings. Setup refuses a conflicting saved owner or a changed host with an actionable reset/recovery instruction; it does not silently ignore flags. Setup with a different `--port` moves the checkout instead: only the saved port changes, data is kept, no reset is needed, and the old and new port are printed; a refusal for a busy port names the holder and gives the exact `rer setup --port N` command for a free port. Heavy commands wait in the machine-wide job gate (`~/.rer/jobs`) for a slot, load at or below 36 and available memory above 2 GiB (macOS free+inactive+speculative+purgeable pages, Linux `MemAvailable`); the waiting message gives position, the jobs ahead with their checkout paths and available memory against the floor, and `RER_JOBS_MIN_FREE_MEMORY_BYTES` changes the floor. `dev` never queues behind other checkouts' jobs. No automatic secret rotation; existing reviewed rotation APIs remain outside these public verbs.

Declare a fresh checkout's default with `commandAdapter(lifecycle, { host: 'localhost' })`, for example when passkeys require that RP ID.
An explicit `--host` wins over the saved origin, which wins over this declaration; dev leaves saved settings untouched.

First setup requires an owner email explicitly, through the manifest answers file, or through an interactive prompt showing any proposed git-email default. Non-interactive mode never silently claims the git identity. Email must be a valid plain mailbox, normalized consistently with mail/auth; never put it or secrets into a shell command. Owner name defaults to `Owner` unless supplied or declared by the manifest. `--answers` is a regular private JSON answer file using manifest names, not an environment file; conflicting flag/file values fail. Conditional required fields and seed-specific workspace answers come from `rer-setup.json`, never new seed-specific CLI flags. A manifest field may declare `localDefault` (a literal for a public field, `{"generate":"hex"|"base64"}` for an entered secret, or `{"from":"origin"}` for a url or text field, which takes the checkout's chosen local origin). Only the zero-setup launch, `rer dev` on a checkout that is not set up, fills an empty active field from it; explicit `rer setup` and `deploy` never do. Generated values go only into the checkout's 0600 private settings and are never printed or logged. Secrets are read privately from declared files/environment or asked privately, never accepted as CLI values or printed. `--non-interactive` means no stdin prompt/browser launch; missing answers exit 3. JSON also suppresses automatic browser opening and prompts.

Missing-answer errors name the missing manifest fields. An answers file is a
private mode-0600 JSON object keyed by those names, for example
`{"OWNER_EMAIL":"owner@example.com"}`, passed with
`rer setup --answers PATH --non-interactive`. Keep secret
values in declared private inputs.

Local setting names come from the seed's existing declarations: `commandAdapter.hooks.secrets.originKey` selects the saved origin, and the setup manifest's `owner-claim.emailField` selects the owner mailbox. Without an owner-claim step, `commandAdapter.input.names.email` selects the mailbox. Undeclared names default to `AUTH_ORIGIN` and `OWNER_EMAIL`. Setup preflight, dev/preview prerequisites and sign-in input, and doctor all use these same keys and the adapter's declared settings file/format. Native-auth seeds retain their own setting names; do not add duplicate aliases or redeclare the manifest's owner field in the adapter.

## Output and exits

Human dev output also prints one line `RER_SCHEDULED TIME "CRON" ok MSms` (or `failed (...)` / `skipped (...)`) per local Cron Trigger run, and `--json` a `scheduled` event, under `dev` and `preview` alike. Human dev/preview output includes exactly one line `RER_READY http://HOST:P` (IPv6 bracketed, no trailing slash) only after the real application health check succeeds. Then:

- **Dev identity** (a `devIdentity` seed's `dev`, including legacy `--login`): `RER_SIGNED_IN EMAIL` names the identity the browser will hold (the owner, or the `--as` persona; omitted for `--as signed-out`), then `RER_OPEN http://HOST:P/__dev/key#rer-dev=KEY&as=PERSONA`. Opening it signs the browser in.
- **Demo** (`dev --demo`): after the dev-identity lines, `RER_DEMO_ENDS_ON_STOP FOLDER` names the demo's own data folder, deleted when it stops. The JSON `ready` event carries `demo:{state,ends}`.

**Why `RER_OPEN` may carry the key.** `RER_DEV_KEY` admits only this checkout's loopback runtime and is never a deploy binding, so the line hands the person at this terminal the same authority as reading `.rer/local/`. The key travels only in the URL fragment: browsers never send a fragment to a server, proxy or log, and the page removes it from the address bar before trading it, through a same-origin POST to `/__dev/key`, for a host-only `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/` cookie. It never appears in a query string, captured log (rer redacts it), JSON progress event or file outside `.rer/local/`. Treat the line as a credential: do not paste it into chats, tickets or another machine.

Setup prints `RER_SETUP_READY URL`, explains that `rer dev` opens the app signed
in, and exits with no server left running. Build/install/verify/reset/deploy/export/import
print their verb, outcome and relevant safe path or URL. Dry-run deployment
explicitly says no deployment occurred.

Failed child commands name the executable (or the adapter's safe command display), exit code or signal, redacted output tail and full log; independent-command failure logs remain available after exit.
Rer preserves the caller's PATH order, appends required tool directories and invokes its selected Node and cached pnpm directly.

With `--json`, stdout is UTF-8 NDJSON only: `{version:1,verb,event,...}`. Bounded commands end in exactly one `event:"result"` with `ok` and `exitCode`; failures emit `event:"error"` with a stable `code`, safe `message` and `exitCode`. Dev/preview emits one `event:"ready"` with `url`; a `devIdentity` seed's event also carries `openUrl` and, for dev, `signedInAs` (an email, or null when signed out). Then comes its eventual result. Progress belongs in JSON events or redacted stderr. Never include values, cookies, generated settings, archives or token-bearing URLs; `openUrl` is the one deliberate exception, for the reason above. A declared-command result can include numeric `childExitCode` and signal.

`describe --json` is one object (the inspection exception to event streaming): `contractVersion:1`, `cliVersion` (the rer version this copy was exported from, recorded by Base's export tools; absent for a copy too old to record one), `profile:"first-party"|"independent"`, `defaults:{serverLimit,idleSeconds}` (what a `dev` or `preview` start applies when the person sets no `RER_SERVER_LIMIT`, `RER_SERVER_IDLE_SECONDS` or `--idle-timeout`), `pins:{node,pnpm}`, `verbs:{VERB:{flags:[FLAG],effects:TEXT}}`, `aliases:{ALIAS:VERB}`, and, for first-party, `local:{state:".wrangler/state",settings:[RELATIVE_FILE],installerState:".seed/installer",prepared:BOOLEAN,ownerSaved:BOOLEAN}` (`prepared` is true once local setup has completed: the private settings hold the owner, the origin and every required generated or supplied secret; `ownerSaved` is true once they hold the owner email, which a later setup keeps), plus `devIdentity:true,devKey:".rer/local/dev-key.env"` for a `devIdentity` seed. It must describe what the parser/adapter actually supports. `check --json` returns a result event with `clauses:[{id,ok,message?}]`; structural failures name the missing verb/flag/alias/pin and how to fix it. Use clause IDs SC-01 through SC-12 below, with more specific subclauses allowed.

| Code | First-party/new CLI meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success, help or completed read-only check. |
| 1 | Executed command/test/health/transfer failed, or contract check failed. |
| 2 | Invalid invocation, flag/value, malformed descriptor or answer/archive syntax. |
| 3 | Missing setup answer, prerequisite/tool version, configuration, authentication or input file. |
| 4 | Safety refusal: unconfirmed reset/import, unsafe state/path/host, occupied requested port, conflicting saved identity, active local operation, unsupported capability, a build holding the dev layer, a local-only deploy key, an archive holding dev sessions or dev-minted credentials, or dev identity beside a managed installation. |
| 130 / 143 | SIGINT / SIGTERM after owned children stop and private files recover. |

Release keeps 0 success, 1 BLOCKED receipt, 2 failed argument/source/artifact validation. Independent declared commands preserve their child's exit status and signal conventions; wrapper validation uses the new CLI codes. An error in the requested operation is never success with a warning. Dev's optional run site privacy refusal is a warning while the app continues (see below). Check is structural; doctor is environment-dependent; neither claims app acceptance or remote health.

## Local sign-in and state

Local dev uses automatic `RER_OPEN` sign-in; the legacy `--login` flag uses the
same flow. Setup builds and migrates, briefly starts the app, claims its first
owner using the private setup token and then stops. Existing owners, data and
private settings survive repeat setup. No captured-mail UI or sign-in messages
participate in this lifecycle. Local operator tooling can obtain a native owner
session through a same-origin POST carrying the session-secret HMAC proof,
only in loopback local mode.

Production deployment refuses when neither outbound email nor an Auth SSO setup
dependency is configured. Validate the actual declared mail bindings and secrets,
or select an exact HTTPS issuer for `oidc-provider@1` and complete its private
approval/link flow. A provider-verified existing mail secret may be retained.
Local setup and demo are exempt from production mail requirements.

**No built-in routes or private files on the public listener.** For every seed, nothing the local runtime serves under `/cdn-cgi/*` (Wrangler's and the Cloudflare Vite plugin's Local Explorer, the scheduled and email trigger handlers, the R2 and platform proxies) answers on the port a person or proxy reaches, and neither do the checkout's private folders (`.rer`, `.seed`, `.wrangler`, `.dev.vars*`) or export archives (the `exports/` folder and any `*.rer` file). rer starts every runtime with `X_LOCAL_EXPLORER=false`, setup's temporary app runs without trigger handlers (preview's runtime has them only when the project declares Cron Triggers, on the internal port), rer's public listener answers 404 for those paths, and rer's scheduler calls the runtime's internal port. `rer export` refuses an `--output` the dev server would still serve: save archives at a normalized path inside the checkout's `exports/` (`exports/x.rer`, `./exports/x.rer` or an absolute path there), or at an absolute path outside the checkout. Outputs elsewhere in the checkout are refused, including public, source and build folders; so are `..` segments, unsafe symlinks and any path served by the app. Upstream connection failures, including while setup is building its app, answer the same 404 as private-path refusals. All three local runtimes (dev, preview and setup) bind a separate loopback port behind this same proxy. The listener answers only its own hosts: a request whose `Host` is not loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]`), a `*.localhost` name or the configured origin's host gets a plain `421` (`This local server answers only its own host.`) and never reaches the app, so an auth check that throws on a foreign Host (operator-auth's `getSession` throws `invalid_host`) can no longer answer with a crash page and stack trace. Vite's `/@fs/<absolute path>` answers only a request holding the checkout's dev key (the key gate's `x-rer-dev-key` header or `rer_dev_gate_<port>` cookie); any other `/@fs` request gets 404 whatever the path, so Vite's refusal page, which lists its serving allow list with the checkout and home directory paths, never answers it. Every seed build must use `archiveOutputGuard()` from the shared onboarding `archive-output.mjs` in its Vite plugins: after public assets and bundles are written, it refuses `*.rer` files and portability archive manifests under any filename, including custom output directories. A seed whose own export writes another format declares it: `archiveOutputGuard({ formats: ['seed-data.v1'] })` (using the format string written by that seed's export) also refuses any built file whose leading JSON object carries one of those `payload.format` strings; a seed that declares nothing is checked as before. The shared lifecycle also checks `dist/` before setup can start its temporary app. A seed's Vite config limits `server.fs.allow` to the folders the app is built from (`src`, `public`, `node_modules`) so nothing else in the checkout is served.

**The key gate** (a `devIdentity` seed). A tunnel or local reverse proxy makes remote requests look local, so the loopback origin is not a guard. For a `devIdentity` seed, `rer setup` writes a random `RER_DEV_KEY` (32 random bytes) per checkout to `.rer/local/dev-key.env` (directory 0700, file 0600); a repeat setup keeps its bytes, `rer reset --yes` removes it and the next setup makes a new one. Only local runtimes receive it: Vite's dev server, setup's temporary app and preview. Opening `RER_OPEN` trades it for the gate cookie. Dev sign-in, persona switching, `/__dev/personas` and tests' `signInAs` need that cookie (or, for the CLI and test harnesses, the key in an `x-rer-dev-key` header); without it each answers 404, through any proxy. A cookie from before a reset is refused. A runtime without the key binding serves none of them.

**Dev identity** (`commandAdapter.devIdentity`). The operator-auth `dev` layer, server-only in its own directory, serves `/auth/dev/enter?as=PERSONA`, which creates or reuses a real `oa_sessions` row of kind `dev` for the owner `rer setup` claimed, or for a persona, so version fences, revocation and deactivation behave exactly as in production. A dev session, and any credential minted while using one, is admitted only on a request that passes the key gate. Until first-run is finished the owner lands on `/setup`. The `owner` persona is the owner `rer setup` claimed while that owner is active; once that owner has left, it is the earliest-created active owner, and `rer dev` names that owner in `RER_SIGNED_IN`; with no active owner left, `rer dev` says so plainly and prints no `RER_SIGNED_IN`. `rer dev` also keeps its `RER_OPEN` link in `.rer/local/open-url` (mode 0600, inside the private `.rer/local`), which `rer reset --yes` removes with the rest of `.rer/local`; stdout, the JSON ready event and `RER_READY` are unchanged. `rer dev --as PERSONA` selects `owner`, `signed-out` or one of the seed's `devPersonas()`: real operators at `<as>@dev.localhost`, created only by local dev sign-in. The app name and browser title identify Dev mode. Export drops dev sessions and dev-minted credentials and marks personas suspended; import refuses an archive that holds either. Dev identity refuses to start when `RER_INSTALLATION_ID` is set beside a non-loopback `RER_MANAGEMENT_ORIGIN`. There is still no static session, sample owner or mail fallback: every dev session belongs to a real operator in the app's own database.

**Invited people in dev and demo.** Every invited or active person appears as
**Sign in as <name>** at `/signin` and, in Base's default app, beside their
operator record. `/auth/one-click?as=EMAIL&returnTo=/app` accepts a live invitation
and opens the app with that person's role. Local entry always needs the checkout's
key cookie or header, including after the invitation is accepted; hosted demos
use the visitor's isolated accounts and the installed demo guard. A local
`/__dev/personas` list also includes these people by email, so
`rer dev --as person@example.com` prints their one-click entry. A person invited at a built-in persona's address (`cleaner@dev.localhost`) is that person, with the role they were invited to, by `--as cleaner` or by the email; a persona never adds or widens a role. Expiry,
cancellation, current inviter authority, allow-list and domain restrictions
still apply. Mail is silently suppressed and there is no mail-reading step.
Production retains its normal email-link flow and refuses this one-click route.

The seed loads the layer only through a local-only entry, never from the
deployed main, and declares `devIdentity: {entry, output}`. `rer build` scans
`output` and refuses any file containing the dev layer marker, naming the file.
Seeds using native authentication retain their real accounts, sessions and roles
and declare their local automatic entry integration.

**Local settings never reach a deployment.** The Cloudflare Vite plugin copies
`.dev.vars` (or `.env`, or process variables) into `dist/<worker>/.dev.vars` for
`vite preview`. `rer build`, the build `rer deploy` runs and a seed's own deploy
hook run with the checkout's local settings files (`.dev.vars`,
`.dev.vars.previous` and the adapter's declared settings) moved aside and
Wrangler's `.env` and process-variable loading switched off. `rer build` and
`rer deploy` then refuse build output (`devIdentity.output`, else `dist/`) that
holds a `.dev.vars*`, `.env*` or `*.env` file, naming it; the deploy kit, the
container image build and the delivery package refuse one too. Add
`excludeLocalVariables()` from Base's `onboarding/local-variables-output.mjs`
(`@runeditrun/rer/local-variables-output` in package mode) to the seed's Vite
plugins so a direct `vite build` drops the file as well.

## First-run setup at /setup

Every first-party seed serves its owner's first-run setup at `/setup`: while setup is unfinished the signed-in owner completes it there (and any app route sends the owner to it); once finished, `/setup` takes the owner into the app (or to settings for later changes). Signed-out visitors are sent to sign-in and back. `rer setup`, dev identity return the owner to `/setup` until first-run is complete, and the README/AGENTS name it (owner, 10 Oct 2026).

First-run completion is stored durably; a setup rerun does not clear it.

## Seed theme

A first-party seed may declare one theme so the shared installer, sign-in confirmation, `/setup` pages wear its look: a CSS file at the root of its served static directory (conventionally `public/rer-theme.css`) holding only `:root` `--rer-*` tokens (page, surface, text, muted, border, focus, optional accent pair, link, font stacks, radius, logo) and `@font-face` rules for font files the app serves. The app serves it at `/rer-theme.css` (a Worker that admits only listed static paths lists it). The installer seed descriptor names it as `theme: 'public/rer-theme.css'`; the Worker passes `/rer-theme.css` to operator-auth `branding.theme`, to `firstRunResponse(..., { theme })`. The installer refuses a theme outside that grammar, naming a file the app does not serve, or whose declared colours fail contrast (4.5:1 for text pairs, 3:1 for focus and borders). Without a theme the pages are unchanged. Vendored seeds keep the token table and wiring note in `scripts/base-onboarding/README.md`.

Operator-auth also accepts optional `branding.mark: '/brand/mark.svg'`, independently of the theme. Serve that SVG or PNG from the installation and allow its static path through the Worker. The root-relative pathname is 2–2048 characters using ASCII letters, digits, `/`, `.`, `_`, `~` and `-`, with no doubled slashes or `.`/`..` segments; URLs, encoded paths, queries, fragments, whitespace, quotes and angle brackets are refused. Sign-in, one-click entry and confirmation headers show the mark at 32×32 beside the product name as text; the dev key exchange header uses 40×40. Images have the product name as alt text and decode asynchronously under same-origin CSP. The explicit mark takes precedence over `--rer-logo`; omitting it leaves the existing HTML unchanged.

## Installed homepage and run site

The run site privacy check matches the saved owner's whole name and exact email
with word/mailbox boundaries, rather than treating them as fragments of other
words or addresses. Names keep the saved spelling and case; email matching is
case-insensitive. Names and emails are checked in every emitted file, including
binary assets, with those identifier boundaries preserved. Secret values and the
dev key still use literal matching in every file.
An exact owner identifier in a README/docs example still refuses `rer build
--site` with exit 4. During `rer dev`, that privacy refusal emits a warning
(`event: "warning", code: "site_private_data"` in JSON), omits `RER_SITE`, and
keeps the healthy app available at `RER_READY`; the refused output is never
served. Fix the example before building or publishing the run site. Other site
build failures remain errors.

Every first-party seed has two homepages. The **installed instance** (what `rer dev`, `rer preview` and the deployed Worker serve) answers `/` with the Lobby: the seed's lockup, its owner setup status, and one button, **Sign in** once the owner is claimed and **Finish setup** (to `/setup`) before that. An owner claim retires the setup token; a later first-run form does not delay the Lobby's Sign in state. A seed whose installed root is a public product page (a status page, a public form, a portal, a help centre) keeps that page at `/` and links Sign in from its header instead. Edition identity chooses which: `installedHome: 'lobby' | 'page'` in the seed's identity value (`EditionIdentity` from `foundation/runtime/identity.ts`, in an edition `src/base/identity.ts`), with its product name, this installation's name, its one-line purpose (`{deployment}` stands for the installation's name), its tagline, its sign-in route, its run site origin and its served theme, mark and optional floor art (`public/brand/band.svg`).

The Worker mounts two shared responses before its documents: `setupStateResponse(request, env, claimed)` from `foundation/runtime/setup-state.ts` answers `GET /setup/state` with exactly `{"state":"claimed"}` or `{"state":"unclaimed"}` (no session, no cookie, `no-store`, 405 for other methods, another origin or Host answered with the ordinary document 404), and `lobbyResponse(request, env, identity, claimed)` from `foundation/runtime/lobby.ts` renders the Lobby at `/` on the server from that same reading, with no JavaScript. `claimed` reads the seed's durable owner claim (`claimedWhen('SELECT …')`); without it both read Base's `oa_bootstrap`. Native adopters update existing first-run queries to read the record that prevents a second owner claim. Neither reveals anything else.

**Sign-in hint: `login_hint`.** The shared sign-in page (`createSignInHandler`, `modules/operator-auth/signin`) accepts one optional query parameter, `login_hint=<email>`, and uses it to fill in the email field of its email-link form. Only a complete email address is used; anything else is ignored, the form is never submitted for the visitor, and the visitor still presses **Email a sign-in link**. The platform's **Open app** link for a claimed owner, a seed's own links to its sign-in route and the Lobby all use this one name: `/signin?login_hint=owner%40example.com`, with `returnTo` alongside when needed. The Lobby adds it to its **Sign in** link only on an instance served on this computer (a loopback or `*.localhost` origin) with exactly one active owner; a hosted instance's Lobby stays the same page for every visitor and never names its owner.

The **run site** (`run-<seed>.com`) serves rendered public pages, with an optional docs-search runtime: the seed's approved homepage with its primary action reading **Run <Seed>** and linking to `/run`, the Run page at `/run` (one copyable line, `curl -fsSL https://runeditrun.com/install.sh | sh -s -- dev <owner/repo>`, for the seed's own repository; Git is required; rer brings Node and pnpm. Already have Node 22 or later? `npx -y @runeditrun/rer dev <owner/repo>` does the same. Run the same line from the same folder to start it again; `foundation/runtime/run-site.ts`), its docs at `/docs/*` when it serves docs, and a `404` page. It never links an instance-only route (`/signin`, `/login`, `/sign-in`, `/setup`, `/app`, `/auth/*`). A seed opts in with the `commandAdapter` option `site: { entry, output, declaration, config }`: `entry` is a module whose `sitePages({ styles })` returns `{ pages: [{ path, html }], assets: [paths under public/] }`. `rer build --site` builds it for Node with the checkout's own Vite (TypeScript, TSX, JSON and CSS imports work, and a React page renders with `renderToStaticMarkup`); the optional `config` names a Vite config holding the plugins the site pages need, such as a docs virtual module or a CSS toolchain (never the app's own `vite.config.ts`, whose Worker plugins do not run in Node). The CSS the entry's modules import compiles to one stylesheet under `/site-assets/`, with the files it references; `styles` lists its site path for each page to link in its head. `output` is the ignored folder `rer build --site` writes (`dist/site` in Base's seeds), with `/` as `index.html`, `/run` as `run.html` and `/docs/a` as `docs/a.html`; `declaration` is the run site deploy declaration, `{"version": 1, "domain": "<apex hostname>"}` (`deploy-site.json`). The build reads no installation data. Before replacing the folder it refuses a site without an index or Run page, with a link that does not resolve on Cloudflare's static assets or reaches an instance-only route, with a page or style that loads from another origin, with server code, Wrangler configuration, migrations, settings or data files, with the dev layer, or with any of the checkout's owner identity, secrets or dev key. `rer dev` builds and serves it as `RER_SITE`; `rer deploy --site` publishes it (see the deploy-kit README, Run site). A Worker that reads `deploy-site.json` in `vite dev` lists it in `server.fs.allow`.

### Optional docs-search runtime

A site with docs may select Base's docs-search module in its command adapter:

```ts
site: {
  entry: 'src/site/pages.tsx', output: 'dist/site',
  declaration: 'deploy-site.json', config: 'vite.site.config.ts',
  clients: { docsSearch: 'src/site/docs-search/client.ts' },
  runtime: {
    type: 'docs-search', module: 'docs-search', bindings: ['ASSETS', 'AI'],
    endpoint: '/docs/search', corpus: '.rer/docs-search/corpus.json',
  },
}
```

`module: 'docs-search'` selects the Base-owned implementation, not seed
JavaScript. This optional runtime declares only `ASSETS` and Workers AI (`AI`);
it does not accept arbitrary application bindings, seed ownership annotations or
a separate Wrangler deployment. `deploy-site.json` remains the same domain-only
declaration. Sites without `runtime` keep the assets-only deployment. Search-enabled seeds declare `esbuild` as a devDependency (the maintained seed pins 0.28.2). Both package and vendored runtimes use that checkout's build toolchain.

The entry's one `sitePages({ styles, clients, contract })` render returns
`{ pages, assets, searchPages }`, where `searchPages` is
`[{ href, searchSections: [{ anchor, titlePath, text }] }]`. `titlePath` is the
array of heading titles. Sections come from the same rendered docs and heading
anchors as the HTML; do not rerender or crawl the published site for the corpus.
The renderer writes `searchPages` to the declared `corpus` path, an ignored
staging output outside the public assets. Its parent (`.rer/docs-search` here)
is also the inferred preparation/cache directory.

Copy the optional UI source from `modules/site/docs-search` to the seed's
selected source path, render `SearchField`, import `search.css`, and load
`clients.docsSearch` as a module script on the docs pages that use it. The seed
supplies `--ink`, `--ink-soft`, `--rule` and `--paper` through its existing theme.
The island queries the declared same-origin endpoint. Adoption preserves the
seed's approved page layout and copy.

`rer build --site` and `rer deploy --site --dry-run` render and validate locally
with no provider requests or embedding calls. The plan identifies runtime type,
module, bindings, endpoint, fixed model `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5`, pooling `cls`,
`corpusHash`, module digest and deployment fingerprint. Vectors are prepared
only for real deployment; a local build does not provide live semantic search.

A real deploy renders once, prepares the vectors, then publishes the rendered
assets, `docs-search-vectors.json` and Base-owned query module together in one
site deployment. Preparation reuses vectors from the inferred local cache and
`https://<site domain>/docs-search-vectors.json` only when the model, pooling,
chunk hash and vector dimensions match. A previous-index 404 means first index;
all other fetch or embedding failures stop before publication. The model and
pooling belong to the selected module. See the deploy-kit Run site guidance for
provider permissions and deployment ownership.

**Deploying the run site from CI.** `rer deploy --site` keeps no state it depends on: it proves the site Worker and its Custom Domains are its own from the provider (the Worker's live version carries its `rer-site:` annotation; each domain's service is that Worker), so a fresh checkout, such as a GitHub Actions runner, deploys over the site it deployed before, and a Worker or domain of the same name it did not make is still refused. The www to apex 301 lives in the Base-generated site Worker. The run-site deploy token (the `run-site` environment's `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) carries Workers Scripts: Edit on the account and Zone: Read and Workers Routes: Edit on the run site zones. A docs-search runtime additionally requires Workers AI: Read/Edit on the account for embeddings and its AI binding; assets-only sites need no Workers AI permission. A seed's `.github/workflows/run-site.yml` runs, after `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm exec rer deploy --site` in the `run-site` environment with `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` from `vars.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` from `secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (vendored mode: `node scripts/rer.mjs deploy --site`); `.rer/deploy/site-production.json` is a receipt for the person and needs no cache. The workflow runs on every push to `main` with no `paths` filter, so a push that changes only `CONTRACT.md` redeploys the site.

## Contract status

A seed's `CONTRACT.md` is its product target and its only acceptance text and
status source. Follow the RER contract standard below. The full authoring and
copy-provenance guide lives beside the parser at `src/base/CONTRACT-DOCS.md`
(the Base file `foundation/runtime/CONTRACT-DOCS.md`).

For snapshots and shallow checkouts, first commit a portable historical proof
with `node src/base/contract-docs.mjs anchor --old FULL_ORIGINAL_SHA` from a
checkout containing that original. Generation verifies `docs/contract/ANCHOR.json`
against the pinned commit and its tree/blob identities. Missing history without
a record and invalid records refuse; full-history checkouts need no record.

- **Sections.** After `# <Seed> target product contract` and one introductory
  paragraph, use these exact second-level headings in order: Product target;
  How to read this contract; Door rules; Shared duties (Base); Published
  clauses; Target clauses; Push further; Field proof register; Boundaries;
  Homepage claims; Retired clauses; Status. Omit only Door rules, Push further
  and Retired clauses when empty. History goes to `CHANGELOG.md`, rulings to
  `RULINGS.md` and mechanism to `docs/`.
- **Product target and tiers.** The two-column table has Category, Incumbents a
  buyer switches from, Up-and-comers it must also beat, and First buyer, naming
  location, currency and time zone. Follow it with `The primary journey:` and
  the buyer's journey in order. Core is the switching buyer's first-week work
  plus push-further, including incumbent integrations, migration sources,
  golden fixtures and native apps where the first incumbent ships one. Agent
  surface is a separate tier. Later preserves premium, enterprise, rare or
  non-US requirements in their original capability areas with their IDs and
  statuses. Preserve recorded owner requirements.
- **Clauses.** Each capability is a `#### <ID> — <Title>` under a uniquely
  named third-level area. Its first line is `*Tier:* Core`, `*Tier:* Agent
  surface` or `*Tier:* Later`, followed only when applicable by From, Cites,
  Rules and Register, in that order, separated by ` · `. A published clause's
  metadata instead sits in a list opening Published clauses, such as
  ``- `NOTE-001`: *Tier:* Core``. Keep at least one published clause. The body
  has only `**Requirement.**`, an optional requirement table, and
  `**Acceptance.**` with one to eight consecutive numbered outcomes. Split a
  capability needing more. Continue a point with at least two spaces. Status,
  Evidence and Gap belong only in the Status table; clause prose names no
  tests. An ID is uppercase words and a two- or three-digit number joined by
  hyphens, or an existing legacy hyphenless ID. IDs never change or get reused;
  new parts take the next number above the prefix's highest ever used number.
- **Shared duties and doors.** List each applicable `BASELINE.md` duty in
  `Base duty | Duty | Delta clauses | Base journey`, with delta IDs or `none`
  and the conformance journey on the seed's own data. Delta clauses cite the
  duty and state only their change; superseding a duty requires owner authority
  and an explicit Supersedes statement. State repeated door obligations once
  as D-n rules and cite them in each clause that proves them. Keep Base's
  shared accessibility bar.
- **Agent surface.** `### Agent surface` is the last area under Target
  clauses. It inherits BASE-AGENT-001 to BASE-AGENT-013, maps each Core job to a
  tool or a reason unrelated to risk, and explains how tool calls receive
  their fleet risk classes. The company's policy decides every call; the
  contract presets no tool or class disposition. Use bold labels for the
  specialist, class facts, resources, events, prompts, limits and handoffs.
  SURFACE clauses have Tier Agent surface and include a specialist week
  through MCP under two company policies, one autonomous for every class.
  People set policy and Pause; agents never widen their authority, act beyond
  the named person's role, misattribute an action, solve a CAPTCHA or enter a
  person's password or 2FA code.
- **Status.** `## Status` is last and unique. It opens with
  ``Judged from the code and tests at commit `<sha>` (<D Month YYYY>).`` Its
  clause table is exactly `| Clause | Title | Kind | Status | Evidence | Gap |`,
  one row per clause with the backticked ID and exact title. Kind is
  `published`, `target` or `push-further`, matching its section. Status is
  `done`, `partial` or `missing`. Done and partial cite existing repository
  evidence paths in backticks; partial and missing have a Gap, done has none.
  Done proves every point through the seed's own doors in recorded Verify on
  the exact candidate, with point-by-point asserting tests and failing
  mutations recorded in the judgement. Rewrites never promote status or
  change the judged revision; split and merged clauses carry their source
  statuses and evidence conservatively.
- **Field proof and claims.** Register only proof the repository cannot
  produce, using `ID | Proof | Clauses | State | Date | Receipt`. R-n rows are
  `not run`, `passed` or `failed`; completed rows have ISO dates and receipts.
  Rows and clauses cite each other; register rows never block done. Seeded
  scale, sandboxes and official-schema test doubles stay in acceptance.
  Homepage claims map the live homepage's claims to clause IDs; the generator
  computes claim status. Keep retired IDs and reasons, every old sentence and
  gap, and remapped downstream references in the rewrite's records.

`ACCEPTANCE.md`, `docs/CLAIMS.md` and the Status summary rows are generated;
never edit them by hand. The summary has exactly Published, Target and push
further, and All rows under `| Clauses | Done | Partial | Missing | Total |`.
`ACCEPTANCE.md` shows Core, Agent surface, Later and Full target progress,
then the clauses by tier with their original acceptance text, evidence and
gaps, plus the Field proof register. Report Core done and full-target done
together. After every contract edit, run from the runnable seed root:

```sh
node src/base/contract-docs.mjs write
node src/base/contract-docs.mjs check
rer check
```

Use the generator beside the seed's actual parser when its path differs. Commit
the generated outputs with the contract, and run the generator's `check` in CI.
Follow `platform/CONTRACT-STANDARD.md`; `node src/base/contract-docs.mjs check-prose` (also run by `check`) fails generated acceptance mappings and tools without a class, and warns on literal Base-duty and ruling/history/mechanism phrases.
For an edition carrying the source-lock tool, regenerate before refreshing its
lock. Its `AGENTS.md` carries these lines in order, with its actual paths:

```text
Lander-Regenerate: node src/base/contract-docs.mjs write
Lander-Regenerate: node scripts/edition-authoring/cli.mjs lock
```

The shared parser remains compatible with older bullet and paragraph clause
definitions and ISO judged dates; new authoring follows the standard above.
`parseContract(text)` in `foundation/runtime/seed-contract.mjs` (types in
`seed-contract.d.mts`; a seed has it at `src/base/seed-contract.mjs`) returns
`{ commit, date, target: { category, incumbents, replaces, alsoBeats, firstBuyer }, areas: [{ name, slug, group, clauses, done, partial, missing, total }], clauses: [{ id, title, kind, status, evidence, gap, area, line, row }], counts: { done, partial, missing, total } }`.
`line` is the definition's line and `row` its Status row. `date` is ISO; the
generator preserves the contract's written judged date. `ContractError.problems`
names each malformed line; the parser never supplies missing values. The
generator's check detects stale generated documents; parser compatibility
alone does not establish conformance to the authoring standard.

**The /contract page.** `rer build --site` parses a seed's `CONTRACT.md` and passes it to the site entry as `sitePages({ contract })`; a contract that does not parse stops the build with each problem's line, and no site is written. The entry adds `{ path: '/contract', html: contractPageHtml(identity, run, contract) }` (`src/base/contract-page.ts`) and passes `contract` to `runPageHtml`, `siteHomeHtml` and `siteNotFoundHtml`, whose headers then link Contract; a seed's own pages and docs link `/contract` only when `contract` is given. The site has one header: Base's on its own homepage, `/run`, `/contract` and the not-found page, or, for a seed with an approved homepage, that homepage's header, passed to `runPageHtml`, `contractPageHtml` and `siteNotFoundHtml` as their last argument (`HomepageHeader`, `HOMEPAGE-VARIANTS.md`), with its own links. Without a `CONTRACT.md` there is no `contract`, no page and no link. The page reads the seed's theme, and the status tokens in `onboarding/README.md` ("Seed theme") recolour it.

`rer check` validates a seed's `CONTRACT.md` when it has one: every parse problem is a failing `CONTRACT.status` clause naming its line, and each evidence path that is not in the checkout fails `CONTRACT.evidence.<ID>`, naming the row's line. A seed without `CONTRACT.md` is unaffected. Run `rer check` in the seed after changing the contract.

## Hosted export adapter hook

An adapter may add the optional `portability.hostedExport` argv array beside
its existing portability implementation:

```js
portability: {
 ...localPortability({ database, buckets, policy }),
 hostedExport: ['node', 'scripts/export.mjs'],
},
```

Only `rer export --target remote` selects this hook. rer appends, in order,
`--remote --environment production --out PATH`, then `--origin URL` when given.
`--output PATH` maps to `--out PATH`; without it rer chooses
`exports/hosted-<ISO timestamp>` with colons and dots replaced by hyphens. Paths
follow the same export destination safety rules as local export. The script
owns the output format (file or directory), must leave it at PATH on success,
and must honor any supplied origin when selecting the hosted install. rer
does not infer that a native export is a `.rer` archive or can be restored by
the local import implementation.

The declaration is either a relative checkout executable such as
`['./scripts/export', 'fixed-argument']`, or a bare interpreter followed
immediately by its relative checkout script, such as the Node example above.
Arguments are individual nonempty strings; shell strings, interpreter switches
before the script, absolute executable/script paths, traversal, symlinks and
non-file scripts are refused by execution and `SC-08.hosted-export` in `rer check`.
Execution uses the project root, the same caller environment pass-through as a
seed's own deploy hook, and the shared bounded command runner for admission,
redacted streaming output and owned-child cleanup. rer reads no hosted secrets
or local settings for this hook: the seed's script uses its own Wrangler auth.
The result and normal export summary name the hosted install, output path and
exit status; the CLI returns the child's exit code. A missing output after exit
0 fails explicitly. No hook is called for plain export or `--origin` alone.
Undeclared seeds retain the existing remote-portability path or refusal,
including its message. SC-01/SC-02 and the `export` package alias stay unchanged.

## Hosted assets and deploy identity

`rer deploy` uploads `dist/client/` behind the Worker (`assets.run_worker_first`), so the Worker sees every request first and a built file reaches the browser only when the Worker hands it to `env.ASSETS`. Make `staticAssetResponse(request, env)` from Base's `foundation/runtime/static-assets.ts` (in an edition, `src/base/static-assets.ts`) the first thing the Worker entry's `fetch` does, and return its answer when it is not null. It answers GET and HEAD for paths with a file extension from `env.ASSETS` (a built `.html` file too: when assets' `html_handling` answers `/guide.html` with a redirect to `/guide`, it follows that redirect inside `env.ASSETS` and returns the file with 200) and returns null on a miss, so app routes and documents keep their own handling; it never looks up dot paths (`.rer`, `.seed`, `.well-known`, `.dev.vars`), `/exports/`, `/__dev/` or `*.rer`. Declare `ASSETS?: Fetcher` in the seed's bindings type; TypeScript rejects the call until the type shares it. A seed that prerenders pages builds with the same routing, so `rer preview` serves them as deployed: give the Cloudflare Vite plugin `config: { assets: { binding: 'ASSETS', run_worker_first: true } }` for the build only (the reference's `vite.config.ts`; under `vite dev` the Worker would also take Vite's module requests). A prerendered page then reaches the browser as the Worker's document, with its `Cache-Control`, under preview as under deploy. The uploaded assets never hold `dist/client/.assetsignore` or any file its gitignore-style patterns name (the Cloudflare Vite plugin writes it with `wrangler.json` and `.dev.vars`): `rer deploy` and the delivery producer's artifact (`modules/delivery-producer`, a seed's `scripts/delivery/base/`) both leave them out, so `/.assetsignore` answers 404 when hosted.

Answer `/health` with `deploymentHealth(env)` from `foundation/runtime/deployment-health.ts` (`src/base/deployment-health.ts`): `{ok: true, deployment: {sourceSha, fingerprint, versionId}}` from the `RER_DEPLOY_SOURCE`, `RER_DEPLOY_FINGERPRINT` and `RER_VERSION` bindings the deploy kit sets. Spread it into a body that carries other fields (`{status: 'ok', ...deploymentHealth(env)}`) and run any readiness check first. Declare `RER_DEPLOY_SOURCE?: string`, `RER_DEPLOY_FINGERPRINT?: string` and `RER_VERSION?: { id: string }` in the bindings type too. `rer deploy` compares these three values with what it just deployed and exits 1 when they differ.

The owner deployment declaration may set top-level `"productDirectory": ".rer/deploy/product"` for a product staged by the build or deploy hook. It must name a normalized checkout-relative subdirectory: no absolute path, backslash, empty, `.` or `..` segment. The directory must exist after the build or hook, with no symlink on its path. rer reads this field and passes `--product` only to the kit's packaging commands (`local-plan`, `deploy` and `health`). A public dry run passes `options.dryRun` to the seed deploy hook for offline preflight; without a custom hook, the owner deployer runs the build lifecycle. Both paths return `dryRun: true`, `deployed: false` and `providerChecked: false` while listing missing real-deploy inputs. Hooks must keep this preflight offline; the wrapper validates legacy-hook artifacts with the local plan without contacting Cloudflare. A hook that invokes the kit itself still supplies `--product` on its own invocation; the wrapper reads the declaration for its own steps. Omitting the field keeps packaging at the checkout root. State, root ownership, secret changes and removal keep their existing locations and behavior; dry run needs no credentials and never reads target secrets.

For an optional canonical public origin, declare `"publicOriginSetting": "PUBLIC_ORIGIN"` beside `originVar` (`AUTH_ORIGIN` or `APP_ORIGIN`) in `deploy.json`. `rer deploy` reads `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` from the adapter's saved settings; the process environment overrides saved settings and `--env-file` wins over both. The value must be `https://host[:port]`, with no credentials, path (including a trailing `/`), query, fragment, whitespace or backslashes; it is normalized to `URL.origin`. When omitted, the origin remains workers.dev. This changes only `originVar`: readiness, health checks, the deployment target, recorded resource names and IDs, and the owner claim retain the kit's workers.dev origin and identity.

A seed's own deploy hook (the `commandAdapter` option `deploy`) returns `{deployed: true, origin}` once its upload is live (an https origin; rer refuses an http one off loopback before sending it anything), plus `setupToken`, the setup token its Worker holds, when that is not the `SETUP_TOKEN` rer passed it in the environment. `rer deploy` then waits until the origin's `/health` names the checkout's commit and claims the owner with that token, needing no deployment record from the hook. A hook that deploys with the kit under its own state file also returns that file as `state` (the kit's `deploy` result names it); rer then reads that record for every later step, so it issues, claims with and retires the setup token, and `--set-secret`, `--unset-secret` and `rer deploy --remove --yes` act on what the hook deployed.

For a hosted owner claim, deploy reuses the name saved by `rer setup` in the
checkout's `.seed/installer/setup-answers.json`, under the adapter's
`input.names.name` field (default `displayName`). If no name is known,
interactive deploy asks once and saves it there. For unattended deployment,
`rer deploy --non-interactive --owner-name 'Maya Chen'` supplies the name;
without a saved or supplied name, it refuses before upload. Names use the same
validation as `setup --owner-name`: nonblank, at most 200 characters and no
Unicode Cc or Cf control characters. Nameless installers retain their existing
deployment behavior.

**Secrets rer generates are kept.** A secret field the setup manifest generates (`generate`, such as a session or subscriber-link secret; not the one-time setup token) that neither the environment nor `--env-file` supplies gets a value rer keeps in `.rer/deploy/<environment>.secrets.env` (an owned 0600 file that Git ignores), beside the environment's deployment record. Every later `rer deploy` of that environment reuses it and says so. Cloudflare reads back only a secret's name, never its value: when a seed's own deploy hook would get a newly generated value for a secret the live Worker (`<project>-<environment>`) already holds, rer refuses before the hook runs, names the secrets, and says how to restore the file (copy it from the checkout that deployed, or set the values in `--env-file`). `rer deploy --rotate-secret NAME[,NAME]` replaces them on purpose: a fresh value is kept and handed to the hook, or, for the owner kit and a hook that deploys through it, set on the Worker as a recorded secret change. The owner kit never replaces a secret its Worker holds, so it keeps a generated value only once it has uploaded it. `rer deploy --remove --yes` deletes the kept file with the environment. The values rer puts in a deploy hook's environment are the ones the Worker must hold, a rotation included: a hook uploads each declared secret as given, rather than keeping what the Worker holds.

**`rer deploy` redacts by what a value is.** A declared secret (a `secrets` entry's binding and environment name, a setup field of kind `secret`), a generated secret, a token, a key or any credential-named setting is redacted in every line `rer deploy` prints, its JSON events and its logs. A declared non-secret setting prints in full, so the closing `Sign in by email at <url>` names the address: a `vars` entry, `originVar`, `publicOriginSetting`, a setup field that is not a secret, or a name in the deploy declaration's `"publicSettings": ["LAMP_APP_HOST", ...]` (upper-case names of `--env-file` or environment settings a hook reads that are not bindings: hosts, origins, names, regions). A name that is declared a secret and also listed public stays redacted, and so does a public setting whose value carries credentials (a URL with a password). An `--env-file` value the declaration does not name stays redacted, and `rer deploy` says which names and how to declare them (the `undeclared_env_setting` warning event with `--json`).

A custom hook using a canonical URL puts it into `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` before invoking the owner kit and declares `"publicOriginSetting": "PUBLIC_ORIGIN"` in its generated deploy declaration. It returns the kit's workers.dev `origin` and `state` for finalization.

Run `rer verify` after refreshing `scripts/base-cli/` from Base in vendored mode, or after updating the exact `@runeditrun/rer` pin in package mode. After the seed's own verification it serves `dist/` in Miniflare from the seed's own Wrangler, with the deploy kit's asset setting, the deploy declaration's vars and origin variable (at an https origin), stand-in secrets and a generated deploy identity, applies the D1 migrations, then requests every built file except dot paths (built `.html` documents included, each by its own path), every same-origin file linked from the built HTML and the home page, and `/health`, and fails on any answer but 200. It needs no network and no account. The declaration is the one `ownerDeploy` reads (`deploy.json`); a seed with its own deploy command names its file with the `commandAdapter` option `deployDeclaration` (for example `deployDeclaration: 'owner-deployment.json'`). In vendored mode, `node scripts/base-cli/cli/hosted-output.mjs . [DECLARATION]` runs the same check on an existing build.

### Mail declarations: own-host and Managed

For an own-host deploy, declare public `MAIL_PROVIDER` and `MAIL_FROM` in
`deploy.json`'s `vars`, and the selected adapter's credential in `secrets` with
its explicit `binding` and `environment` mapping. Base's shared adapters use
`MAIL_API_KEY`; direct Resend and SendGrid adapters can use `RESEND_API_KEY`
and `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, respectively. A seed adapter that instead reads
`MAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY` must declare that binding. Cloudflare mail also needs
`MAIL_ACCOUNT_ID`; an own-host installation using the `rer` relay also needs
its assigned HTTPS `MAIL_RELAY_URL`. Credentials stay private runtime inputs.
Provider, sender and relay URL are public configuration, including in the
mail spec and Wrangler vars; remove legacy `MAIL_PROVIDER` and `MAIL_FROM`
entries from `deploy.json`'s secrets when adopting that layout.

Managed mail is the explicit capability `mail: {"providers": ["rer"]}` in
the seed's delivery spec. The platform supplies `MAIL_PROVIDER`, `MAIL_FROM`,
`MAIL_RELAY_URL` and private `MAIL_API_KEY` at runtime; the seed need not list
platform-supplied credentials in its own-host `deploy.json`. Declare the
public names in `publicVariableNames` (or `publicVariables` in the integration
projection), and credentials in `secretNames` or `optionalSecretNames`.
The hosted check reads `artifact.specInputs` from `rer-packaging.json`,
`packaging.json` or `scripts/delivery/base/packaging.json`, and the direct spec
at `management/integration/deployment-spec.json`. When `mail.providers`
includes `rer`, it adds stand-ins only for explicitly listed mail credentials:
`MAIL_API_KEY`, `MAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY` and `SENDGRID_API_KEY`.
This also supports a Managed-capable seed retaining a direct-provider adapter
for its hosted check. It does not synthesize unrelated secrets, undeclared
credentials or missing public configuration. An own-host seed without that
Managed capability still needs its credential in `deploy.json`; omitting a
required binding remains a failing `/health` check.

A deploy secret's stand-in follows the setup manifest's kind or default;
its nonempty `verifyStandIn` overrides that choice and any spec-derived
stand-in. For example, the legacy declaration
`{"binding": "MAIL_PROVIDER", "environment": "MAIL_PROVIDER", "verifyStandIn": "resend"}`
selects a hosted-valid provider when the setup default `development` would
answer 503. Stand-ins exist only in the local hosted check: `rer deploy` never
sends, plans or prints them. Passing this check proves the declared runtime
can become healthy; it does not prove live mail credentials or delivery.

A deploy secret an app can run without (an integration's credential) adds `"optional": true`. When neither the Worker nor the deploy inputs hold it, `rer deploy` still deploys, names it as not set, and binds nothing for it, so the app must treat its absence as not connected; a required secret still stops the run before any write. `rer deploy --set-secret NAME` sets it later and `--unset-secret NAME` removes it, each recording the Worker version it makes, so the next deploy accepts that Worker and an unchanged repeat writes nothing. A group of secrets goes in one command, `rer deploy --set-secret MAIL_API_KEY,MAIL_FROM` (or the flag repeated, `--set-secret MAIL_API_KEY --set-secret MAIL_FROM`), each value from the environment or `--env-file`: all of them change in one Worker version or none do, and a missing value is named before anything changes, so a page can give one copy-paste command for the whole group.

Start document responses send `Cache-Control` with `no-transform`, keeping their other directives (the reference's `uncachedStartResponse` sends `no-store, no-transform`). It stops any proxy rewriting the HTML React hydrates; Cloudflare's email address obfuscation honours it. Cloudflare documents that obfuscation does not apply to HTML a Worker generates, which is how `rer deploy` hosts every response. A Worker that proxies an origin on the same Cloudflare zone instead passes `fetch(url, { cf: { scrapeShield: false } })` on that subrequest, or the owner adds a Configuration Rule for the hostname with `email_obfuscation: false`. The deploy kit changes nothing for this.

## Package conversion and run-site adoption

`node scripts/export-cli.mjs --to-package SEED_ROOT` removes the old
`check-cli-copy.mjs` and `check-onboarding.mjs` wrappers and their package-script
steps. They check Base's deleted vendored tree and copied internal suite;
`rer check --profile first-party` checks the installed pin. Keep seed-owned
application/onboarding journeys, and run them against that pin.

Small browser islands declare `site.clients`, a map of names to entries:

```ts
site: {
  entry: 'src/site/pages.tsx', output: 'dist/site', declaration: 'deploy-site.json',
  config: 'vite.site.config.ts',
  clients: { hero: 'src/site/hero.client.tsx' },
  clientConfig: 'vite.site.client.config.ts',
}
```

`sitePages({ styles, clients, hosting })` receives each emitted module URL, for example
`clients.hero`; link it with `<script type="module" src="…"></script>` on the
pages that use it. Browser modules and their reachable imports/assets are
bundled under `site-assets/`. `clientConfig` is optional, separate from the SSR
page config, and names browser plugins such as React; an external import still
reachable from an island refuses the build. No seed-specific client plugin is
needed. The rendered page's appearance and copy stay seed-owned.

`hosting` is the public context derived from the seed's deploy, setup and mail
declarations, or `null` when those declarations do not support the shared
walkthrough. When hosting context is provided, include `/docs/hosting` through
Base's shared hosting page. It follows the chooser's order: the one line, then
Assisted, then Managed when `paths.product` is a listing and `managed.open` is
not `false`, then the do-it-yourself walkthrough, which explains deployment
using the actual declared resources and inputs; it does not store deployment
credentials.

`RunData.leadLine` is an optional plain string for the product's owner-facing
lead. Base escapes it as text, uses it as the composed homepage heading and
repeats it below the `/run` heading. The hero leads with what the product does
for its owner; "free" and open-source are a short footnote or secondary line,
never the hero line. Custom homepages may read the same field. When it is
absent, both shared pages keep their existing HTML byte-for-byte. Existing
seeds can `rer refresh-base` without adding the field or consenting to a new
edition migration; the earlier `run-data-paths` and `run-data-pricing`
migrations still apply when crossing their introductions.

Base's shared `/run` chooser reads `RunData.paths`: `product` is the app listing
id or `null` while the seed has no listing; optional `requirementsExtra` adds
one requirements sentence; optional `assisted.open` and `managed.open` can each
hold a door closed with `false`. Reference data and newly initialized seeds
start with `paths: { product: null }`. `RunData.pricing` carries the Assisted
and Managed prices and their shared `note`; reference and initialized sites
read the single `runPricing` value in `run-pricing.ts`. `PATHS` reads that data
for prices and the label, so changing it changes the built chooser as well.
`RunData` no longer carries `hosted`,
`requirements` or `folder`. Name, repository and clone command remain seed data.
Keep the shared sign-up state and entry URL builder in the single `PATHS`
constant in `run-site.ts`; seeds do not add their own plan links or sign-up
state. Both doors close while sign-ups are by request, when the listing is
null, or when that door's `open` is `false`. Entry links carry the plan and the
listing id when available; an unlisted seed uses the shared repository-derived
`run-<slug>` entry product until it has a listing.

Known targets at browser resource operations, including fetches, imports, DOM
URL writes and emitted CSS, are checked against the run-site boundary. Inert
URL construction/parsing and URL-shaped data are not resource use. Unresolved
runtime targets do not alone refuse the build: they appear in
`site.references.unresolved` with the emitted asset and operation kind, and in
the human-readable report. This adds no published asset and does not certify
unknown runtime targets; a known disallowed target or prefix still refuses.

Owner names/mailboxes already present in committed, unchanged source (matching
HEAD, Git index and working-tree bytes) are published examples and do not refuse
the site build. Untracked files, staged or dirty changes and private settings
cannot exempt an identifier. Secrets and dev keys are always refused, even if
committed. Without Git, identifiers remain private.
The Lobby stays script-free in dev; `RER_OPEN` and `dev --login` use the separate
`/__dev/key` document for key exchange, with its exact-hash CSP.

`export/run-site.yml` is the guarded push-to-main/manual deployment template:
**add it only when the per-seed gate holds**. Copy it to
`.github/workflows/run-site.yml` only after the seed's public-switch record,
owner-reviewed main page, source/run-page proof and deployment prerequisites
hold. The owner/orchestrator enables `RUN_SITE_DEPLOY=true` on the seed's public
repository at that gate. The template pins the Actions, installs the seed's
frozen rer pin, and checks the Run page and www redirect after deployment.
Copying the template alone does not enable deployment.

## Adopting Base's import, erasure, migration and dependency fixes

Each needs a Base refresh (vendored copies) or the rer pin that contains it.
Base's own `default-seed` shows every one in use.

### Erasing a person named in many imported records

`retireD1ImportCustody` costs a few statements per job, not per affected row,
when the people adapter implements the optional `redaction(db, destination,
fields)` scope (default-seed's `person-redaction.server.ts` is the reference):
300 reactions take one request, 3,000 too. Mark alternate identifiers
`optional: true` instead of dropping fields after `readD1ImportFieldMatches`.
When a person's values span more than about 150 imports, pass `{ resumable:
true, continuation }` as the fifth argument and, while the result's `phase` is
`redacting`, queue the next call with its `continuation` (default-seed's
`erasePerson` and its `redact` queue message); start native erasure only after
`complete`.

### Erasing a person who appears only inside someone else's record

Call `retireD1ImportCustody({ values, related: { fields } }, [], context,
checkpoint)` without a `target` for a person with no native record of their own,
such as a cancelled invitee on another invitee's booking: their fields leave
every source, effect, before-image and native row, originals holding them are
withdrawn, and the shared record keeps its resume and undo. Replace a seed's
`erasure_import_shared_source` refusal with this call.

### Importing files too large for one request

Use the shared door's resumable `uploads` action. Send bounded chunks with
per-chunk and complete-bundle SHA-256, then request a plan from the completed
upload. Apply that plan in bounded calls with the exact reviewed fingerprint
until the returned job is complete; reconcile and undo through the same door.
Do not recreate the old review/prepare/publish routes or call stream job APIs
from the move-in screen. The door adoption guide lists its ordered migrations
and native-adapter size requirements; unsupported sizes must fail visibly.

### Shipping a reviewed rewrite of a released migration

Declare it in `migrations/rewrites.json`: `{ "version": 1, "rewrites": [{
"migration": "0019_import_custody.sql", "from": "<released SHA-256>", "to":
"<current SHA-256>", "reason": "...", "reviewed": true }] }`, and add a later
migration that converges databases that applied the released bytes. Deploy and
local runs then upgrade past it; anything else that changed in applied history
is still refused. Keep the record for as long as an installation may hold the
released digest.

### Seed table inventories and Base's tables

A seed inventory that refuses unknown tables skips the ones archives never
carry with portability's `excludedTable(name, policy)` (or the
`excludedTables` list), which includes `_rer_deploy_migrations` and the other
migration ledgers. Do not delete or rename those tables.

### Shared dependency fixes

Base's lockfiles resolve sharp 0.35.5, undici 7.29.1, source-map-js 1.2.2,
esbuild 0.25.12 and later, and playwright 1.63.0, and `pnpm audit` finds no
known advisory in them. Copy Base's `pnpm.overrides` for `sharp`, `undici` and
`@esbuild-kit/core-utils>esbuild` into the seed's root `package.json` (and any
vendored `mail` package), run `pnpm install`, and run the seed's suites. Base's
own suites showed no behaviour change from undici 7.29.1; Mango's one red
move-in journey on it did not reproduce.

## Seed mark, readable actors and refresh-safe forms

Three shared rules from the seed quality report. Each arrives with a Base refresh
(vendored copies; `src/base` for the two runtime files) or the rer pin that
contains it; Base's `default-seed` shows each one in use.

**The seed's own mark (SC-14).** While a seed's logo, favicon or app mark is
byte-equal to Base's placeholder "F" (`foundation/template/public/brand/mark.svg`),
`rer check --profile first-party`, `rer build --site` and `rer deploy --site`
print one warning line naming the files ("Base's placeholder mark is still in
<files>; replace with the seed's own mark."; a `warning` event with code
`placeholder_mark` under `--json`) and do not fail, so a live run site keeps
redeploying. `rer release` refuses it unless `--allow-placeholder-mark` is
given; the receipt then records `placeholderMark: { allowed: true, files }`.
Base's foundation and default-seed reference projects are exempt. Adopt: when
the seed's brand round comes, draw its mark, replace
`public/brand/mark.svg` and every copy the warning names (favicons, site assets),
and the warning stops; until then, release with `--allow-placeholder-mark`.

**Names, times and labelled evidence.** `src/base/actor.ts`
(`foundation/runtime/actor.ts`) turns an actor id and a timestamp into
`actorLine(directory, id, at, timeZone)`: "Maya Chen · 16 Oct 2026, 3:04 pm
AEDT". An id the directory does not hold (an erased, removed or unrestored
person) reads "Former member", never the UUID. `evidenceHtml(details, {
directory, timeZone })` renders an evidence, details or snapshot object (or its
JSON text) as a labelled `<dl>`: nested fields read "Decision › Reviewed at",
actor-shaped fields (`actor`, `approvedBy`, `operatorId`…) resolve to names,
timestamps render in the business time zone, and nothing renders as raw JSON or
`[object Object]` (`evidenceFields` returns the same as text for other
renderers). `operatorDirectory(db)` reads operator-auth's display names; add the
seed's own people (members, staff, agents) to that map. Declare the business
time zone as `timeZone` in the seed's identity (`EditionIdentity`), or pass the
installation's own setting. Adopt: replace every place a screen prints an actor
id, `JSON.stringify` of evidence, a raw journal or a UTC timestamp with these.

**Refresh-safe writes.** `src/base/command-receipts.ts`
(`foundation/runtime/command-receipts.ts`) with its table
`command-receipts.sql`. A create form carries `commandKeyInput()` (a fresh key
each render); its handler runs the create through `runOnce(db, { actor, command,
key: commandKey(form) }, create)` and answers `seeOther(location)` (303 to a
GET), so a refresh reads the result and a resubmitted form (Back, a retried
request, a double click) returns the first result instead of creating a second
credential, publication or key. A key in flight answers 409; a failed create
releases its key. `create` may return `once`, a part shown only to the first
`readReceipt` (a new credential's token): redirect to `?done=<key>` and read it
there, never in the POST's own response. JSON creates take the same key as an
`Idempotency-Key` header (default seed: `POST /api/people`). Archives never
carry `rer_command_receipts`. Adopt: apply `command-receipts.sql` as the seed's
next numbered migration (new foundations get `0015_command_receipts.sql`), then
route every create form through `runOnce` and 303, removing any branch that
renders a result page from the POST itself.

## Hydration units

A mismatch between the server HTML and what React hydrates (an extension linking an address, a translator, a proxy rewrite) makes React client-render the nearest Suspense boundary; under TanStack Router that is everything under the root route, and the root route's own chrome is in no boundary at all. Seeds wrap every page section and the root chrome in `HydrationUnit`, mark one-time entrance animations with `data-intro` under the root's intro guard, hydrate through a `src/client.tsx` that passes `createRecoverableErrorHandler()`, keep addresses as lone text and send `no-transform` on documents. The convention and the adoption steps are in Base's `foundation/runtime/hydration/README.md` (in an edition, `src/base/hydration/README.md`).

`rer verify` checks it right after the hosted-output check, on the same served build at its https origin. Chromium answers every request from that serve and aborts external requests, so it needs no network, account, owner or setup. Each page is loaded with every application script held in the network layer until an in-page probe releases it, so its edits always land before hydration:

- a plain load (elements React replaces even then are excluded from later loads; any console error, page error or counted recovery fails);
- for each page section (an outermost `header`, `nav`, `section`, `article`, `aside` or `footer` in `<body>`), a text node beside siblings split and its second half wrapped in a span (an address linkifier), or a lone text node changed in place when the section has none, with scripts released after every one-shot animation has finished and, when the section holds an intro, at the midpoint of its intro;
- text beside sibling elements outside every section, split the same way;
- when the page shows an email address, its HTML rewritten as Cloudflare's email address obfuscation does, with the decoder running before hydration and with the anchors still present;
- a plain load with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

Verify fails when an element outside the edited section (or any section, for loose text; or outside the sections holding addresses) is replaced; a one-shot animation restarts more than two frames late or an animated element's opacity falls by more than 0.15 after rising; a frame lacks a section present at the edit; a rebuild comes with a console or page error, or without `window.__rerHydration.count` of at least 1; the document of a page React hydrates sends `Cache-Control` without `no-transform` (a redirect or a page React does not hydrate is not held to it); a one-shot animation runs under reduced motion; or the check was not exercised (an edit landed after hydration; React had hydrated before the probe released the held scripts, as when the client bundle is inlined in an inline module script the check cannot hold; a held script reached the page before that release; or no edit on a page with sections made React rebuild anything). A page's plain load fails on any console or page error or counted recovery. A plain-HTML page (React never hydrates it, it loads no application script and its plain load raises no error) is listed and skipped; a page that loads application scripts or raises an error and never hydrates fails, naming the scripts and the error. Application scripts are script requests to the page's own origin, module scripts and `modulepreload` links in the served document from any origin (client scripts on a CDN host are aborted like every external request, so such a page fails), and cross-origin module fetches the page starts; a third-party classic `<script src>` is not one. The result's `hydration` lists each page, its sections, its load count, its cases and advisories: text beside sibling elements that holds an email address, which never fails verify.

Pages are the page `/` answers, following same-origin redirects (at most five, so a signed-out `/` that redirects to `/sign-in` checks `/sign-in`), plus same-origin links on that page that answer 200 HTML without a session (following only a trailing-slash redirect), at most six. Name them instead with the `commandAdapter` option `publicPages` (for example `publicPages: ['/', '/docs/start']`). A check that loads no page (`/` answers an error or redirects to another origin, and no `publicPages` are declared) fails naming what it did not check, never passes. Verify prints each page with its loads or why it was skipped, each redirect followed and each link not checked; the result's `hydration` carries them as `pages`, `redirects` and `notChecked`. The check runs Chromium through the seed's own Playwright (`playwright-core`, `@playwright/test` or `playwright` resolved from its `package.json`); without one, or without its Chromium (`pnpm exec playwright install chromium`), verify fails naming what to install and never skips. In vendored mode only, `node scripts/base-cli/cli/hydration/check.mjs [ROOT] [--origin URL] [--pages /,/x] [--details]` runs the same check on the existing `dist/` build, or with `--origin` against a running `rer dev` or `rer preview`; against `rer dev` each rebuild also shows the dev hydration warning, counted in `--details`.

## Pins, aliases and responsibility

Convert an unedited vendored seed with
`node scripts/export-cli.mjs --to-package SEED_ROOT [--version X]`. The converter
removes edition components that selected only the removed tooling, prunes those
paths and mappings from mixed components while retaining app source, and drops
delivery verification/packaging globs rooted in the removed folders. It keeps
the app's Base copy records and source origins. No hand edits to `edition.json`,
`rer-project.json` or delivery `packaging.json` are needed before `test:base`
and `rer check`; run the converter's documented `pnpm install` next.

Journey tests launch the installed package's `global/rer.mjs` from their own
checkout, with `--foreground` on dev launches. Node launches and pnpm package
aliases (including argv assembled at runtime and run through `nice`) use that
entry; other pnpm/Vite/Wrangler commands keep their own arguments. That launcher can install the pin
in a fresh scratch checkout before dispatching it; a path into the scratch
checkout's `node_modules` cannot. README shell shims give dev the same foreground
lifetime. The hosted-output and hydration command entries resolve symlinks, so
calling their installed pnpm package paths runs the checks and reports failures
instead of silently exiting. These sources ship in the next orchestrator-owned
rer release; refreshing vendored seeds uses `node scripts/export-cli.mjs SEED_ROOT`.

Required first-party pins: `.node-version` is `22.20.0`; `package.json.engines.node` is `22.20.0`; `packageManager` is `pnpm@10.12.4`. Keep any `.nvmrc`, CI/bootstrap and documentation declarations consistent. These are today's tested Base cloud-bootstrap/foundation pins, not a requirement for independent projects. Commands that execute project work select the exact Node pin, using an exact matching installed runtime or a checksum-verified user-cache copy at `~/.rer/node/node-vVERSION-PLATFORM-ARCH/`; when needed on supported platforms, the runner retrieves the official release and verifies its SHA-256 against `SHASUMS256.txt`. The runner never changes global Node installations. `RER_NODE_AUTO=0` opts out; a failure reports the repair invocation `npm exec --yes --package=node@VERSION -- node SCRIPT VERB --cwd PROJECT`. Help, check, describe, doctor and stop do not select or acquire Node. pnpm works the same way: when the person's PATH has no pnpm of the pinned version, commands that run project work use rer's own copy of the pinned pnpm, fetched once from the npm registry, its tarball checked against the registry's sha512 integrity before anything is extracted or run, and kept at `~/.rer/pnpm/pnpm-VERSION/`; only that rer command's PATH carries it, nothing global changes, and a PATH that already has the pin is used as it is. Doctor counts an already cached copy and never fetches one. Refresh lockfiles legitimately for pnpm 10 and retain the reviewed native-build allowlist (esbuild/workerd where needed).

Documents name the production command, `rer VERB`. A seed takes rer in one of two modes, and `check` accepts either. In vendored mode the `scripts/rer.mjs` copy, the `OPERATIONS.json` argv and the `package.json` aliases below are the machine contract, and the installed `rer` runs each verb with that checkout's own `scripts/rer.mjs` (SC-01, SC-02). In package mode the seed carries no vendored copy and pins `@runeditrun/rer` as an exact devDependency locked in `pnpm-lock.yaml` (SC-13); its argv and aliases are `rer VERB`, its delivery operations (`rer-project.json`, `scripts/delivery/base/packaging.json`), the scripts they run and its CI workflows call `pnpm exec rer VERB` and never the removed copy (SC-13.package.calls), its adapter imports the package's exports (`@runeditrun/rer/adapter`, `@runeditrun/rer/operator-installer` and the rest listed in the package README), and heavy package scripts use `rer queue NAME -- COMMAND`. `node scripts/export-cli.mjs --to-package SEED_ROOT [--version X]` from Base converts a vendored seed; local edits to the copy go through `pnpm patch` or upstream to Base.

In vendored mode, ship a byte-exact pinned Base CLI export at `scripts/base-cli/`, with thin `scripts/rer.mjs` dispatching it. It includes its transitive portable command/release sources and export inventory; it never reaches a neighboring Base checkout. Do not duplicate a second onboarding tree: import the seed's existing byte-exact `scripts/base-onboarding/` through the documented export boundary. Base itself retains `bin/rer.mjs` as a thin dispatcher.

Package scripts for `setup dev preview build verify reset deploy export import release doctor describe check` run the dispatcher for that verb: each value is the OPERATIONS argv (`["node","scripts/rer.mjs",VERB]` vendored, `["rer",VERB]` in package mode) joined by single spaces. Invoke them as `pnpm run VERB -- FLAGS`; in particular use `pnpm run deploy`, not pnpm's built-in deploy. Never define a package `install` lifecycle script to launch `rer install`; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` is the equivalent dependency action. Provide `deps` (the same dispatcher with `install`) and `rer` (the dispatcher alone). Internal adapter targets use distinct names/files (for example, a verify suite entrypoint) to prevent alias recursion.

Use OPERATIONS v2, preserving environmentSources and loops. Its `commands` declares every required verb with real argv, inputs and effects; inspector/CLI verbs still perform only their documented inspection. Opt in to the first-party profile with `seedContract:{version:1,profile:"first-party",adapter:"scripts/installer/local.mjs"}`. This is a small operations extension, not another configuration file or a second setup schema. An explicit `rer check --profile first-party` must enforce the profile even if its marker has been deleted; this flag is additional to check's common flags. References and generation tests must also require the marker. No package/edition presence alone makes an independent project first-party.

Each seed adapter exports `commandAdapter` alongside its installer integration:
declarative hooks and targets for dependencies, build, migrations, start,
health, owner, sign-in, verification, deploy and portability; state/settings
removal inventory; and the selected manifest. Reuse `localInstaller`,
`onboarding/commands.mjs` and `onboarding/local/` guarantees. The CLI owns
argument validation, profile resolution, locks/recovery, sequencing, pins,
captured/redacted child execution, health readiness, confirmation, JSON/exit
mapping and cleanup. The seed owns product answers, real resource
names/migrations, approved auth overrides, data policy and actual
build/dev/verify targets.

A seed whose build rewrites tracked-looking files that are not source (generated migrations, widget or download assets, route trees, delivery output) lists them in `commandAdapter.generatedOutputs`: project-relative files or directories, for example `generatedOutputs: ['.generated', 'public/widget.js']`. Preview's fixed-build receipt and its during-build check ignore exactly those paths and nothing else. A real source edited during the build is still refused with its file named, and an undeclared file the build rewrites is refused with a message naming it and this declaration. Without the declaration nothing changes.

A seed that must keep data `rer reset` would otherwise delete (legacy state still to be recovered, for example) declares `commandAdapter.resetPreflight`: an async function given `{ root }` that throws to refuse. Reset awaits it before showing its inventory or asking for confirmation, `--yes` does not skip it, and a refusal exits 4 with the thrown message and removes nothing.

Every first-party adapter selects one root `rer-setup.json` manifest. The CLI,
installer and deploy producer share its field selection and digest rules; do not
create a second setup schema. Every first-party seed proves local
export/import/export equivalence across all supported resources. Local
export/import must cover every supported resource. Remote transfer is optional
and requires complete resource coverage; an unsupported remote target fails
with exit 4 and names the missing capability.

Import defaults to target `local`. Before archive access or preparation hooks,
an explicit `--origin` must be HTTP on exactly `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or
`[::1]` at this checkout's configured local dev port, unless `--target remote`
is explicit. The configured port comes from the checkout's saved local origin;
without a saved origin, the local default is 8787. An omitted HTTP port means
80. HTTPS origins, all other hosts (including front-door `NAME.localhost`)
and different ports therefore require `--target remote`, even if `--target
local` was supplied. No origin and matching local origins preserve existing
local import behavior. Explicit remote selection does not bypass the adapter's
complete remote import capability check; unsupported remote import still
refuses with exit 4.

A seed that imports people through Base import-kit erases a person from import custody with `retireD1ImportCustody({ target, values }, nativeStatements, context, checkpoint)`, not `eraseD1ImportTarget` alone: `target` is the native entity their records were imported into, `values` are their exact identifiers (an email, never a name, never matched as a substring), `nativeStatements` are the erasure module's `nativeStatements(entity, subject)`, and `checkpoint` is portability's `redactionStatements()` mapped through `toD1Sql`, so native rows, the portability fence, the restore checkpoint and import custody commit in one batch before `deleteBlobs`. Records become tombstones and other people's imports keep undo and resume; an import whose header equals a value is retired whole and answers `IMPORT_JOB_RETIRED` with its journal `receiptId`. Apply `d1RetirementSchema` as the next numbered migration after the other import-kit schemas (a seed that already applied it adds `d1RetirementAppendOnly` as its next migration), keep `ik_d1_erasure_journal` and `ik_d1_retirements` in archives, and read the journal with `readD1ErasureJournal`. An archive made before the erasure is refused whole under `--journal LATER_ARCHIVE` on a fresh store, even one that held the person only in import custody. The default seed's people imports (`src/core/features/people/`) are the reference adoption.

For shared imported records, pass `related: { fields: [{ path: ['reactions', '*', 'users', '*'], value: sourceUserId }] }` in that same `retireD1ImportCustody` call. Exact matching array items or object fields are removed; peer entries and explicit aggregate counts remain. Paths are relative to source payloads and effect/native values and apply to undo before-images too (the default seed uses `details.reactions.*.users.*`). The kit atomically sanitizes the adapter's imported native set, rebinds custody/provenance/decision hashes and fingerprints, withdraws affected original artifacts, and cancels destination private preparations; resume and undo use the sanitized retained data. Keep the same restore checkpoint and journal export policy. The adapter must enumerate and exactly fence its complete imported native set; the seed handles references elsewhere and filters erased identities on new source intake. Field selection requires an unbounded context, like other related erasure. Existing D1 erasure/retirement schemas suffice; no rer release or schema evolution is implied. See modules/import-kit/README.md#erasing-fields-in-retained-shared-records.

Erasure (`modules/erasure`) takes only its subject and costs time linear in its rows. A key column named like a `json_each` column (`id`, `key`, `value`...) is now qualified with its table when remembered rows are re-read, so one subject's erasure can no longer delete another subject's rows of an `id`-keyed table (or lose its re-read check). The first step orders the whole plan and queues what it leaves in `rer_erasure_scope` (no new table); each later step reads and verifies only its own slice, and one last step re-collects the graph from the subject and every remembered parent. A seed that carries an adapted copy of `plan.mjs` for this (Spool) drops it and re-records the byte-identical copy. Index the child columns an edge matches on, as foreign keys usually are.

`retireD1ImportCustody` refuses caller-supplied `nativeStatements` when the batch carries no checkpoint (`IMPORT_RETIREMENT_NATIVE_REQUIRES_CHECKPOINT`, before any write): only the checkpoint fences rows the kit does not count, such as another import's job. A seed that passes its native statements with the checkpoint, as the reference does, changes nothing.

Portability's `unbase64` validates in linear time with no recursion, so a store holding a binary cell or an R2 object of a few megabytes (the old validator overflowed its stack from about 4 MB) exports and restores. The seed's copy of `modules/portability/hash.mjs` is re-recorded; nothing else changes. A seed whose own code validates base64 with a repeated-group regular expression (Slate) replaces it the same way and repeats its large-original round trip.

Backup-only legacy recovery (`rer import --legacy-v1`) accepts a fresh installation: FTS5 shadow tables (`<index>_data|idx|content|docsize|config` of a `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ... USING fts5`) and the rows the destination's own migrations seed (compared with a scratch replay of the applied migrations) no longer make it `legacy_target_not_empty`; any other row, an added or edited seeded row, or a real row in the FTS5 index still does, and the same check is repeated inside the restore batch. A seed that carries a local recovery wrapper for this (Nook's `scripts/local/legacy-recovery.mjs`) drops it. A seeded table that the policy lists in `replaceableTables` is replaced by the restore as usual.

A normal `rer import` into a fresh installation accepts the rows the destination's own migrations insert, such as a seed's default settings: a target table holding exactly the rows a scratch replay of the applied migrations leaves (Node runners) is replaced by the archive's rows in the restore batch, or kept when the archive predates that table, and the same check is repeated inside the batch. Any other row still refuses, and the refusal now names it: `Restore refused (target_not_empty): table T in this installation already holds rows its migrations did not insert, …` followed by the export, `rer reset --yes` and `rer import` commands to run (`bucket_not_empty` names its bucket the same way). A seed that lists its migration-seeded tables in `replaceableTables` only so a restore works may drop them; a hosted (Worker) import has no replay and still needs them listed.

An import job is bound to the principal that created it, and its plan and fingerprint carry that principal, so a restored job cannot be rebound to the new owner's operator row. Give the import context a principal that survives a restore: the operator's role, not the operator's row id (`principalId: 'role:' + operator.role`, with the authority predicate checking that this operator is still active in that role). A restored installation's owner then undoes, resumes and reads the originals of the restored jobs, a different role cannot, and an archive never chooses a principal. The default seed's people imports are the reference adoption; a seed that binds jobs to operator ids (Penny's UserVoice imports) adopts the same change, and jobs created before it stay bound to their operator.

Independent projects without an adapter use `OPERATIONS.json` v2 `commands.NAME.argv`, `inputs`, effects, environmentSources and loops. Execute argv directly with shell false in the checkout, forwarding explicit arguments after `--` unchanged; never translate them into Cloudflare/pnpm/Base behavior. Common wrapper flags are consumed before the separator. No declared verb means exit 4, not an inferred command/fallback. Existing v1 inspection remains supported. Do not infer runnable commands from the platform registration descriptor's shell strings. No global pins, aliases, installer, state layout or required verb set is imposed on independent projects; runtime requirements remain project-owned. Independent check still validates the actual declaration and refuses missing/outside-checkout inputs.

## Optional grant authority for the shared import door

A seed may explicitly mount import-kit's D1-only
`createImportDoorHandler(options)` from `modules/import-kit/src/door/index.ts`
under POST `/api/rer/import/{uploads,plan,apply,status,reconcile,undo,archive,restore-check}`
(the last two grant-only). This is
the optional grant authority for the same pipeline used by the signed-in
operator mount, not a second importer. The seed supplies its database, real
target adapter, parser/mapping, destination and actual owner principal, and
applies `importDoorSchema` in a new numbered migration after its D1 kit schemas.
A seed that already installed the door never re-applies `importDoorSchema`
(it refuses on that older door schema, so the deploy fails rather than keep the
old plan table). It applies the door migrations once each, in order, each in a
new numbered migration: `importDoorApplyFailureMigration` as a single atomic
batch, then `importDoorScopesMigration`, then `importDoorArchiveMigration`.
Until the first two are applied, an enabled door answers every route with 503
`import_door_schema_outdated`; without the third, only `archive` and
`restore-check` do.
Base does not mount the door in a seed automatically. Copy the module's
`CONTRACT.md` and `src/door/README.md` with its runtime and dependencies.

The grant mount returns 404 until the installation explicitly opts in. This
setting does not disable owner-session imports or owner Undo. Mount
`createImportOperatorHandler` from `door/operator.ts` with the same stable
server-owned installation key, native adapter and source allow-list, and mount
the grant handler first. The seed's server-only existing owner session, or
provisioning under the owner's approved
plan, writes enablement through `writeImportDoorSettings` with a current owner
SQL predicate. The same control revokes trusted key ids permanently; rotation
uses a new id. The public door cannot enable itself. Each request requires a
fresh single-use ES256 grant from the same trusted key ring as owner-claim,
binding installation, owner, action, logical namespace, expiry and upload/record
quotas. Grants last at most five minutes. Apply also binds the owner's approval
record/time and exact retained plan fingerprint; the body's
`reviewedFingerprint` must match. Mutation batches recheck enablement, revocation
and expiry. Existing operator-session binding and authority remain intact.

Uploads are resumable and check per-chunk and complete-bundle SHA-256. Plan
reports server-derived counts, rejected rows and catch-up differences without
native writes; apply runs bounded kit batches. Catch-up adds inert records and
replaces only unchanged import-created records using original provenance revision
and native-value fences; missing source records are listed without deletion.
Bounded catch-up needs standing owner approval and a nonempty baseline, refuses
missing/conflicting/rejected/unmapped records, and requires additions plus
replacements to be strictly below 5% of baseline source count. Other changes
require a new reviewed proposal. Reconcile derives source-id presence and
disposition, native/provenance values, revisions, attachments and counts.

Use `readImportDoorHistory` under current owner authority with the shared door
key to join approval metadata to real jobs from both authorities. Caption local
approvals "approved by" and Business approvals "approved via Business by",
including the owner, time and fingerprint. The ordinary seed owner can undo those jobs with the same configured
principal; snapshots undo newest first. Original bytes stay in the seed and RER
retains receipts only. The seed owns route integration, native field sampling
and acceptance evidence. This module has no external side effects and makes no
hosted capacity claim. See import-kit's copied contract and door README for the
exact grant fields, request bodies and recovery rules.

## Acceptance clauses

- SC-01: required verbs, real flags, thin self-contained dispatcher and truthful describe output.
- SC-02: exact pins and public aliases, no lifecycle/built-in collision or recursion.
- SC-03: real manifest-driven setup, private custody, idempotent owner and failure recovery. Validate the selected dependency graph before effects; claim the native owner then pull-link selected dependencies. Declared idp claim mode completes the atomic provider owner grant before readiness. Blank optional dependencies preserve standalone email-link setup; unchanged links need no new approval. Link approvals are private, exact-origin and callback-set, one-use files, deleted after successful use. Multiple interfaces use the private `RER_LINK_TOKEN_FILES` interface-to-file map; each approval is validated before effects.
- SC-04: managed foreground development/HMR and fixed production preview, requested origin, health-gated ready output, intact public-input/output build reuse and descendant cleanup.
- SC-05: Automatic local owner entry; no `/cdn-cgi/*` route or private checkout folder answering on the public listener; for a `devIdentity` seed, the per-checkout key gate on every local sign-in surface, real key-gated dev sessions and personas, a local-only entry whose layer `rer build` refuses in output, refused local-only deploy keys, dev data kept out of archives. `rer check --profile first-party` enforces the entry and the build exclusion (`SC-05.dev-identity.*`); it reads the deployed main from `devIdentity.deployConfig` when declared, else from `wrangler.jsonc`, `wrangler.json` or `wrangler.toml` (skipping any the adapter lists in `generatedOutputs`), else from a deploy template such as `deploy/wrangler.template.toml`. Copies of Base's operator-auth layers that the seed records (`base-copies.json`, `composition.lock.json` or `foundation.lock.json`) stay byte-exact to the Base revision they pin, in two groups checked on their own: the application, runtime and schema copies (every copy outside `scripts/base-cli/`, including operator-auth migrations) share one pinned revision (`SC-05.auth-copy.pin`), and the CLI's bundled tooling copy under `scripts/base-cli/` has one pinned revision of its own (`SC-05.auth-copy.cli-pin`), so a seed can refresh the CLI to a newer Base revision while its application auth stays at an older reviewed one. Two revisions inside one group fail that group's pin, and `rer check` names each drifted, missing or unrecorded file in either group (`SC-05.auth-copy.*`).
- SC-06: confirmed, contained, local-only reset and clean subsequent setup.
- SC-07: real build/verify and production preview, owner-account deploy/dry-run and unchanged release producer/receipt/exits; bounded expensive execution joins the shared queue. After deployment readiness, link selected dependencies to the real deployed origin using its own approval. Dry-run has no link effect; no additional public verb is introduced.
- SC-08: complete local export/import, integrity, empty-destination/confirmation and credential exclusions.
- SC-09: structural check rejects omissions, doctor names missing inputs, stable JSON and exits.
- SC-10: optional independent execution uses only declared argv, preserves child outcomes and forces no stack.
- SC-14: the seed carries its own mark; check and run site builds and deploys warn on Base's placeholder mark, and releases refuse it unless `--allow-placeholder-mark` is given, which the receipt records.

## Managed servers and bounded work

Dev and preview are managed servers with explicit stop and
idle-timeout controls. `--detach` returns after readiness and leaves the server
running; `--foreground` keeps the invocation active while serving. A
compatible repeated invocation verifies the registered live application,
emits its readiness and automatic sign-in URLs and exits 0 without another build/sign-in. They
share one canonical-checkout slot;
symlink/cwd aliases share it, distinct worktrees do not. The other mode or an
explicitly conflicting host/port/timeout refuses
with exit 4 and the correct stop instruction; `--as` only changes the printed
`RER_OPEN`, so it reuses a running dev server. Mode changes require stop then start. `--stop` is idempotent when
absent, needs no tools/settings/build, refuses another live mode, and rejects
start-only flags before effects.

Idle timeout precedence: explicit `--idle-timeout`, `RER_SERVER_IDLE_SECONDS`,
then 43200 seconds (12 hours). Positive integers only. The clock starts at readiness.
Application HTTP, assets and application activity reset it; active requests/streams
prevent expiry. Internal management/readiness probes and HMR control
traffic alone do not count. Real application WebSocket data messages do count.

Private registry: OS home `~/.rer/servers`, with `RER_SERVERS_DIR` override.
Combined cap: 10 servers per computer by default. Set `RER_SERVER_LIMIT=N`
(positive integer) to change it. Load is no guard by default; a fleet sets
`RER_SERVERS_LOAD_THRESHOLD=N` (the 1-minute load) in its own environment.
The disk floor is twice the measured logical file bytes in installed
`node_modules` and `.wrangler` (including local D1 state), plus 256 MiB, with a
1 GiB minimum. Symlinks are not followed or counted twice. It checks the
checkout, selected temporary directory (`TMPDIR`, then `TMP`/`TEMP`, then the OS
default), and the actual server registry directory. A not-yet-created path is
measured on its nearest existing ancestor. A refusal names the requested path
and exact free and required bytes. `RER_SERVERS_DISK_FLOOR_GIB=N` explicitly
replaces that estimate (GiB, decimals allowed, 0 disables the floor). Atomic reservations
precede ports/heavy work and count toward capacity. A start that sets
`RER_SERVER_LIMIT` is capped by that value, higher or lower, whatever running
servers recorded; a start that sets nothing is capped by the lowest limit a
running server's person set explicitly; a recorded default never lowers the cap. `RER_SERVER_LIMIT_FILE`, when set, names a file holding a positive integer that is read at each start and is the cap, over `RER_SERVER_LIMIT` and every recorded limit; an unreadable file or a non-integer refuses the start naming the file. At capacity refuse 4 with a plain message giving
the count and the limit, each running server's checkout, mode, port and exact
stop command, and how to raise the limit; a load refusal states the load, the
threshold and how to override it. A
server is stopped only by its own checkout (explicit stop, idle timeout, signal),
never to make room for another, in any mode. A run that declares itself a test
or CI journey with `RER_SERVER_JOURNEY=1`, on its own free port, is neither
counted nor refused by the cap. Verify lifetime/process identities and health; preserve
foreign/unverifiable processes. Cleanup all owned descendants and private/state
custody before freeing records/ports; old generations cannot remove replacements.
Explicit stop/idle exit 0; child failure remains nonzero; INT/TERM retain
130/143. Starting duplicates wait boundedly and never announce a failing startup.

Preview serves real built Worker/assets/routes/private streams/404 with exactly
one workerd, no Vite/HMR, source/config watcher or automatic rebuild. Queue one
cache-miss build; reuse only when actual dirty/untracked/shared/copied runtime,
config/lock/tool inputs and intact output bytes match a nonsecret `.rer/local`
receipt. Never hash private settings. Missing/corrupt/interrupted output or an
input change during build invalidates certification. Require ordinary prior
setup/migrations; missing prerequisites name `rer setup` and exit 3. Preserve
private bytes/modes, owner, origin overrides and canonical `.wrangler/state`
D1/R2/KV/DO. Verify health and automatic local entry before ready.

Heavy install/build/verify targets, directly documented browser suites and
indirect/generated scripts use the exported dependency-free Base job queue module.
Setup uses the shared RER installer lifecycle for build, migrations and a
bounded temporary runtime. Dev/preview queue finite preparation; managed serving uses the server
cap and never outlives a released job as its descendant. Deploy queues local
build/validation including a read-only target-secret dry run; release queues expensive steps
without changing its producer/parser/receipt/exits except adding `--no-queue`.
Export/import queues local resource runtime work. Help/describe/check/doctor,
stop and reset inventory/removal stay light.

Labels identify the declared project, initiating verb/phase and safe checkout
identity without credential remotes or secrets. Status/waits are human progress,
valid JSON events or redacted stderr. Human queue waits report immediately with
a reason and numeric one-based position, then refresh about every 15 seconds.
In package mode there is no queue status verb; a waiting command reports its
live position. In vendored mode, inspect the live queue from the runnable
project root with `node scripts/base-cli/modules/job-queue/cli.mjs status`.
Nested commands share only validated live
owned membership, never a boolean bypass; slots=1 works. Queue cancellation
removes pending work; admitted cancellation stops owned children and restores
private files before releasing the lease. Queue/state locks cannot deadlock.
Original-caller `CI=true` skips queue admission. Heavy-capable verbs alone accept
`--no-queue`, only with original `CI=true`; other use fails 2 before effects.
`CI=false`/unset queue. Synthesized install child CI cannot change the original
policy. Independent commands preserve their declared argv/stack and outcomes.

- SC-11: canonical managed foreground server lifecycle, real request activity,
  exact idle/stop/cap defaults, identity-safe crash recovery and deterministic
  cross-process admission, with complete cleanup before reuse.
- SC-12: real queue coverage of every bounded expensive path, portable
  dependency-free sources, safe labels/output, validated nested membership,
  original CI policy, cancellation/custody and light inspection boundaries.

## First-party agent instructions and current entry points

Every first-party `AGENTS.md` opens, directly under its title, with a short
`Launch for review` section, in place of the earlier `Run it locally` recipe;
`CLAUDE.md` is exactly `@AGENTS.md`. The section tells an agent asked to
launch, run or review the app to run `rer dev` from the checkout root and
nothing else: it installs and sets up a fresh checkout by itself and prints
progress, so the shell tool gets at least 10 minutes, and a timed-out call is
resumed by running the same `rer dev` again. The agent never runs install,
setup, reset or deploy for a review and never asks for an email, port, password
or answers file. It gives the owner the `RER_READY` address and the `RER_OPEN`
link (a credential, shared only with the owner in that chat) and asks nothing.
It stops the app with `rer dev --stop` and, on a refusal, runs the next command
the message names. One line tells a reader without `rer` to run
`npx -y @runeditrun/rer cli install` or the installer script on the RER site.
Base's `export/AGENTS.md` holds the current wording; keep the section under
about 25 lines.

Below it, show the commands for a real owner installation from a runnable
edition root:

```sh
rer install
rer setup --owner-email you@example.com
rer dev
```

Explain how to enter the real owner mailbox through the setup prompt or an
approved flag, then open the app: a `devIdentity` seed's `dev` prints
`RER_OPEN`, which opens it signed in as the owner (`--as` selects another persona;
legacy `--login` uses the same entry). State whether external mail is sent
and preserve the actual local auth and data requirements. Stop `dev` with
`rer dev --stop` or Ctrl-C, and stop `preview` with
`rer preview --stop` before build or verification. Then show the current
verification, reset, deployment and description commands:

```sh
rer verify
rer reset --yes
rer deploy
rer describe
```

For data move-in, put the signed-in import door first, in plain words, with
`/app/import` as the copyable first step. Describe upload, review, apply,
reconcile and Undo, and the seed's actual supported formats. Show low-level
archive commands under a "Back up and restore this installation" heading:

```sh
rer export --output exports/installation.rer
rer import --input exports/installation.rer --yes
```

Explain their empty-destination requirement and the absence of a door plan and
Undo. Keep source-copy seed creation (`exportReference` /
`scripts/export-reference.mjs`) separate from installation data export.
Document the actual flags, effects and cautions for each operation.

Base's root guide directs maintainers into its runnable first-party seed.
Composed foundation input becomes runnable after composition, and its agent
guide runs from that edition checkout. Describe managed foreground server
behavior and compatible repeat invocations according to the current command
contract.

Maintain first-party documents and entry points as current guidance. Remove
superseded setup, dev, install, reset, deploy and verify wrappers and
instructions, including descriptions of earlier flows. Keep the commands and
behavior the RER CLI actually uses, and retain real product, architecture,
authentication, data, security and deployment requirements. RER adoption stays
optional for independently authored projects.
