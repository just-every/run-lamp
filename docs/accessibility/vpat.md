# Run Edit Run Accessibility Conformance Report

VPAT® Version 2.5 Rev, Revised Section 508 Edition (April 2025).

Product name: Lamp
Product version: 1.11.1
Evaluation date: 25 October 2026 (UTC; 2026-10-25)
Report date: 25 October 2026

Edition note (28 October 2026): Version 1.11.1 reorganizes the contract documents. The evaluation date, measured scope and limitations below remain those of the 1.11.0 evaluation; this edition claims no new accessibility evaluation.

## Product description

Lamp is a self-hostable status page and incident communication application. It publishes public component states, incident and maintenance permalinks, history and subscription forms; its operator application composes those records. This report describes the release source, not a separately deployed installation or every possible owner-authored message.

Contact for accessibility questions or defects: [Lamp repository issues](https://github.com/just-every/run-lamp/issues). Include the page, browser, assistive technology and steps; do not include private subscriber or incident information.

## Notes and scope

This is a limited evaluation report, not a declaration that Lamp meets every WCAG 2.2 AA criterion. No criterion is marked Supports before criterion-specific evidence has been measured in this round. The conservative Partially Supports entries below flag incomplete evaluation; they do not assert that an automated pass proves a complete criterion. This reporting limitation is stated explicitly because the ITI template reserves Not Evaluated for Level AAA, and this report contains only A and AA tables.

Public status, history, incident permalink, subscription management and maintenance permalink are the intended browser scope. Private pages are Not Applicable to this release surface because AUD-002 has not shipped: there is no private-page implementation to evaluate. This does not waive PAGE-020's future private-page obligation. Subscriber confirmation, incident-update and maintenance-notice HTML emails are also in the measured browser scope. Email client combinations, all operator screens, translated content, every page layout, owner-customized themes and all error/empty/hover states are not fully measured. No overall conformance claim covers those surfaces.

The public footer's Accessibility (VPAT) link opens this report on the app host. The report itself is public on the app host at `/docs/accessibility/vpat`.

## Evaluation methods used

The report structure follows the [ITI VPAT® 2.5 Rev 508 public template](https://www.itic.org/dotAsset/c9497d16-4684-480c-bae2-99256283731c.docx), read on 23 October 2026, and the [ITI instructions](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat).

Measured on 23 October 2026 in the existing PAGE-020 case of `tests/e2e/maintenance-timezone.test.mjs`, using `tests/e2e/helpers/accessibility-subscription-flow.mjs`: axe-core 4.12.1 with WCAG 2 A/AA, 2.1 A/AA and 2.2 AA tags found no serious or critical findings at 1440 and 390 pixels on the public status page, history, incident permalink, maintenance permalink, this VPAT, subscription result, confirmation, management and saved-selection pages. Each page had no horizontal overflow; the journey found no hydration mismatch. Keyboard-only Tab, text entry, Space and Enter subscribed and changed component selections, with visible focus, explicit email-to-submit and checkbox-to-checkbox order, and persisted selection assertions. The existing held accessibility suite was not rerun in this round; these measurements extend a free registered maintenance case without changing the held suite. `tests/e2e/start-runtime.test.mjs` separately confirmed the built app-host GET returns this nested document. `tests/release-history.test.mjs` and `tests/docs/docs-site.test.mjs` passed the release refusal and nested-manifest fixtures.

Measured on 24 October 2026 in `tests/e2e/delivery-contract.test.mjs` (Attributed operator additions, confirmed component scope, private management and opt-out), loading `tests/e2e/helpers/subscriber-add-flow.mjs` in push Verify’s delivery shard: actual confirmation, incident-update and maintenance-notice HTML captured at the Resend network edge are complete English documents with wrapping prose and no preformatted body. Each HTML part is loaded with `page.setContent` at 1440 and 390 pixels; axe-core WCAG 2/2.1/2.2 A/AA checks require no serious or critical finding, and each has no horizontal overflow. This browser rendering does not establish email-client compatibility.

Automated testing cannot establish complete WCAG conformance. No human screen-reader session was run; a live-region attribute assertion is not an assertion that a screen reader announces it. No zoom, alternative input device, speech recognition, braille display or email-client compatibility evaluation is claimed.

## Applicable standards and guidelines

| Standards and Guidelines | Included in this report |
| --- | --- |
| WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA (ISO/IEC 40500), the Revised Section 508 baseline | Yes, limited evaluation as detailed per criterion |
| Revised Section 508, published 18 January 2017 and corrected 22 January 2018 | Yes, Chapters 3, 5 and 6; hardware is not supplied |
| WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 Level A and AA | Supplemental product benchmark, not an assertion of overall conformance; later-version criteria are labelled |

## Terms

Supports: the functionality has at least one method that meets the criterion without known defects or meets with equivalent facilitation.

Partially Supports: some functionality does not meet the criterion. In this report this conservative level also identifies criteria whose full scope is unmeasured, as disclosed in Notes; it must not be read as complete evaluation or a claim of Supports.

Does Not Support: the majority of functionality does not meet the criterion.

Not Applicable: the criterion is not relevant to the product or surface, with the reason stated.

The existing public live-status journey in `tests/e2e/public-contract.test.mjs` additionally evaluates the default, Calm headline, Uptime-history-led and Regions map layouts at 1440 and 390 pixels. Published incident text and resolution update a persistent polite, atomic status region; unchanged refreshes and relative timestamps do not mutate its announcement, and generation clocks remain outside it. Axe and horizontal-overflow checks cover each layout. This is browser delivery evidence, not a measurement of actual screen-reader announcements or complete WCAG criterion conformance.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 401–415 Hardware | Not Applicable | Lamp supplies web software and documentation, not physical hardware. |
